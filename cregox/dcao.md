# {{ page.description }}

[![{{ page.image }}]({{ page.image }})](/gallery#{{ page.gallery }})

its value only works for me. it opens just the first door and it will eventually lead me to a small room with a shower.

if you need a place to sleep or take a shower, get in touch and i can probably help.

in all cases, the key without me will be useless to you.

just leave it there, thanks.
