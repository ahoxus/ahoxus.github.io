![transmission]({{ page.image }})

there are way more customers than agents in every great business.

and too many of them have redundant issues.

but there's also a big lot with complex problems. and bugs not only in the system, also with the group's human errors.

now...

think of a forum in which (per default):
- emails are turned into public posts, with an instant reply to opt out
- you can enter a topic and have a chat like conversation with one person or a group
- you get instant notifications of new messages on your chat or topic, plus emails when you're not online
- you'll get summary emails when the topic gets closed

a bit crazy, huh?

but think about it:

- forums are much faster than email and don't require so much time interacting such as chat, phone or email
- integrated with the community. not just employees would have access to moderation tools, for instance, but also volunteers who enjoy your group! (like in stack exchange or discourse)
- offer *up to* full transparency, in layers. open source projects should love this. i.e. versioning and automated local backups, like email SMTP. in yet other words: the moderators can be moderated by anyone
- no trackers. anonymous IDs, following ideas of covid19 private trackers. no need to waste so many precious resources by tracking. results speak louder
- manually assigned badges, that can be manually revoked, but scrubs only by different levels of trusted users, can promote whatever behaviour is needed from users, moderators and agents
