at some point in 2015 I thought it would be fun to try making something like [9gag tv](http://9gag.com/tv) or [ifls](http://www.iflscience.com/team/elise-andrew/) (later on I found out about something [very similar](https://www.patreon.com/lolhehehe) to my will, except I have no wish to produce anything in non-english).

I ended up creating [a private category (you won't be able to see this link) in talk](https://talk.cregox.com/c/fas-tv) called "fas tv", as to see how good (or bad) I could build it over some time, before publishing. had this written on its about:

> curated [f]un, [a]wesome and [s]cience items from the web. content that could show in an **adult** TV. only our very favourite ones.

well, it never worked.

I still **may** try to ressurect this project eventually since I actually got [many related offline files](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7x-Yn04UquwWEpGdFZPT0F5Nkk) I wished to share in a more interesting fashion (and probably not all of it). also because (as evident from the collection below) links break. and it hurts. [me](/backup). :(

but it will probably stay dead / undead.

meanwhile, at least I think there's a good and fun collection of links that came out of all this: the google plus one, below. which I ocasionally still update.

tl;dr;

here's the only thing left from this (yet another) failed project: [cregox fas tv](https://plus.google.com/collection/4Qqrb)
