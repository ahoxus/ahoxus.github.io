at some point in 2015 I thought it would be fun to try making something like [9gag tv](http://9gag.com/tv) and [ifls](http://www.iflscience.com/team/elise-andrew/)

I actually created [a private category](https://talk.cregox.com/c/fas-tv) in talk called "fas tv", as to see how good (or bad) I could build it over some time. I had written this on its about:

> curated [f]un, [a]wesome and [s]cience items from the web. content that could show in an **adult** TV. only our very favourite ones.

well, it obviously never worked. I still wish to ressurect this project eventually... meanwhile, at least I think there's a good and fun collectino of links out of it: the google plus one below.

tl;dr;

finally, I even made a g+ collection, which I still ocasionally update. it's the only thing left from this (yet another) failed project: [cregox fas tv](https://plus.google.com/collection/4Qqrb)
