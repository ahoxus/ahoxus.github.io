hi.

c+aue speaking.

[a former programmer for 20 years](/cregox/resume), turned into a wildcard person (or something on those lines).

literally living in the wild!

you may find more about me, for now (2021 october), [on my outdated website](http://cregox.net), but mostly around the web.

both cregox and ahoxus sites will go through radical transformations, due to the [[achoz](/achoz)] project.

stay tuned! ðŸ˜˜

ps: no suggestion below will work as the internet should... reason why i will probably need to build achoz. but they do get pretty damn close to it, specially if we could mix them all along with a few more...

# mastodon

meanwhile, be sure to check out [@cregox@banana.dog]().

# delta.chat

i still recommend [delta.chat messenger](https://cregox.net/delta) if you care for true and simple reliance of your own data.
