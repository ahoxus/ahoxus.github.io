Right now, got "just" those 3 (not 4 anymore, the one from squarespace is completely gone):

- [old](http://cauecmrego.blogspot.com) (blogspot) just for reference
- [new](http://talk.cregox.com/c/blog) (discourse) in most use, but soon will be replaced
- [sidekick](http://blog.cregox.com) (jekyll) need to allow commenting before becoming official

Hopefully I'll be able soon to make all this more concise.
