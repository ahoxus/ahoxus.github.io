# {{ page.description }}

**ahoxus** is content for you.

it could be your life's project: [a big piece of land](/map) to live with your friends, family, sand neighbors while fully enjoying and improving the surroundings for the present and future.

in this site you can find ideas around how we can live in shelters at the countryside (over 15ha, north of portugal, since march 2020 in our case), with trees and away from the cities or big buildings, mainly by following some steps of many giants (such as [tamera](/tamera)).

we shall cultivate the land to have better water and nature than before we arrived. all along with some basic, cheap, and incredible conveniences, like a solar heated shower and the internet, while learning how to not rely only on them.
