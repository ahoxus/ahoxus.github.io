**ahoxus** is (as of february 2020) a plan for a group of people to live and work together towards improving our reality.

and we invite **you** to join us!

# what?

"our reality" means both of our group and of everyone. starting small. slowly. steady.

the project is loosely based in [**tamera**](//tamera.org)'s healing biotope, with all the science and political theory, but none of the pseudo science that surrounds basically [all similar projects](/map). it's also a sort of regenerative culture movement. slow and steady.

think of a tiny country in a small piece of land, without any army. or perhaps imagine a self sustainable (rather than sustained, we don't plan to be off the grid, just to be able to, if needed) "community-reserve", in the sense we want to be treated at least like a natural reserve.

in practice, we're going to live in trailers in a piece of land with trees and away from the cities or buildings. and cultivate the land to have better water and nature than before we arrived. without completely forgetting some basic and cheap conveniences, like a hot shower (solar heated) and internet.
