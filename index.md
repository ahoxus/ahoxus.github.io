# the big kid

> a long time ago a big kid, aH, was playing around and chasing a beautiful butterfly on the sunrise.

> suddenly, aH saw another kid, oX, doing some chores, annoyed, and felt the back as if hit by a lightning bolt. aH felt on the ground, in a deadly pain with an almost silent and deep roar.

> oX, who was annoyed by something, came around, saw aH on the floor, remembered how sometimes aH just lay down there, and complained something to aH then moved away, annoyed for getting no answer. after a while oX came back and finally noticed aH was seriously injured.

> now worried about the weird deadly pain, they went to seek help. took a long path over the mountains, to find other big kids: the medics. one looked at the injury and heard their story. then, the medic was sorry, for there was nothing the medics could do. then the medic continued to take care of other kids, who were bleeding or unconscious.

> aH was, after all, basically recovered by the time it took to get to the medic. but the pain was real. and so was the invisible internal scar...

ahoxus was born after the real story on which this little tale is based; on aH, oX and their friends' quest to heal and discover ways for others to follow the same steps.

after all, isn't that the same story for everyone?

# [not really...](#top)

think about it. we all need so much more reconnection with ourselves! both in general (just look at how fast the world can heal when we stop and take it slow) and within each one of us (also to prevent such inexplicable body malfunctions).

ahoxus is made of people who live and work in a land, together in small groups, towards improving and regenerating the whole world through little actions.

and we invite **you** to join us!

# [what?](#top)

yes, you, who might be willing to understand our quest, and discover it together.

> ps: we're making weekly [updates](/updates) in a very transparent manner (by "very", i mean "messy") using **pioneer**. if you are reading this and coming from [pioneer](/pioneer), by all means, please [read that](/pioneer) first!

# [still... what?!](#top)

in practice: we're going to live in cheap shelters on a piece of land with trees, away from the cities or big buildings. and cultivate the land to have better water and nature than before we arrived. without completely forgetting some basic and cheap conveniences, like a hot shower (solar heated) and the internet.

# [ok... sounds crazy!](#top)

well, yeah.

it's big!

after all, "the whole world" means both each small group's reality and of everyone's.

we are constantly focusing on the small things. moving slowly. steady.

# [come live with us](#top)

starting march 31st 2020 we started to model a plan for new members. all costs here are per small family (a couple and 2 children below 20kg). same costs for an individual.

we want people who are ready to shift their world. read everything here. talk to us. act by yourself.

with as little as 5k eur and highly suggested upper limit of 50k you can get a mobile home in our land. you can later move it out to anywhere you want, shall you choose to. it's your home!

there are 10 spots open now. the daily costs for living, covering everything inside the land, will be 20 eur when the project hits phase 2. it includes every basic need, such as water, food, electricity and internet, and completely self sustainable.

it's now entering phase 1, which also includes all basic needs but is not yet able to sustain itself. it will, however, start to build everything needed for that. and, as such, the daily cost will start as low as 10.

this daily cost can be further reduced, depending on how much value you can bring. everyone will be required to live and work in the community. kitchen. garden. maintenance in general. an equivalent shift of up to 4h per day average, 20h per week. but we don't really think in those terms, as you'll learn...

donations are highly encouraged, since they'll be for everyone's benefit. no money is needed, but there's always improvements that can be made in the structure. you can easily retire for at least 10 years within our life style with just 60k in your pocket, for an estimated analogy.

no smokers. zero tolerance in this phase. it's essential for security against wood fire, in portugal.

only organic material is allowed to go in the land, from cosmetics to paint and anything that may quickly leak underground.

recapitulating the main points:

- be ready.

- bring your home.

- get at least 3650 eur ready for minimal costs over 1 year.

- pay attention to all details

- come enjoy life at its fullest!
