**ahoxus** could be your life's project: [a big piece of land of land](/map) to live with your friends and family with zero need of **anything** from the outside!

in this site you can find plans about how we are living in shelters on this piece of land at the countryside (10ha, north of portugal, since march 2020), with trees and away from the cities or big buildings, mainly by following some steps of many giants (such as [tamera](/tamera)).

we will cultivate the land to have better water and nature than before we arrived. all along with some basic and cheap conveniences, like a solar heated shower and the internet.
