**ahoxus** is our life's project: a self-sustainable intentional community, also a regenerative culture movement, in 10ha of land north of portugal in 2020.

we live in cheap shelters on a piece of land on the countryside with trees and away from the cities or big buildings. we will cultivate the land to have better water and nature than before we arrived. all along with some basic and cheap conveniences, like a hot shower (solar heated) and the internet.
