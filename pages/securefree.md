on top of every page on this website, when accessing through SSL (also known as HTTPS) you should see a notice like this:

> if your connection is secured (uses https) for no good reason (since this site offers zero risk), do consider using a non-secure connection for marginal gains that add to the whole world! http://ahoxus.org

and you may ask: what does it mean?

# zero risk?

you can see the whole website source code (look at the bottom of every page). and it uses the most free license we have in this world today (agpl), meaning you, as a user of this website, because you read it on a computer, have full legal rights to see everything done behind the scenes.

perhaps you, dear user, don't know what to do with it. it surely can become overwhelming. but someone, even automated tools, can look at it for you. and they already have done it. just search online for your own and you will see how this site offers the most secure connection you can have over http, with no need for extra complexity...

man in the middle attack probably became the main argument used in favour of https. in many different flavours, going as far as injecting code in unsuspected machines to perform denial of service attacks. the supposed security offered by https against those threats can look like very real, but they only really add a level of complexity in the eternal "game" between legal and illegal activities created by law.

if you want security of your data, you need to focus on one thing only: backup. have a backup plan for everything, including banks and government themselves. trust only in yourself.

we offer zero risk by offering knowledge and transparency which can't get tampered because you have to devise your own logic and see for yourself if you can agree. simple.

# marginal gains?

the complexity added by a secure layer (the SSL or the S in HTTPS), comes at a heavier cost than it may seen at first.

after all, to the user, the complexity got hidden away into a locker icon on your browser.

but it exists nonetheless.

it requires extra computing costs in both sides. and it makes every sense if you want to transmit sensitive data, such as bank passwords.

but, in here, we don't use even cookies. nothing. zero complexity or data sensitivity!

the extra computing costs comes along with text support hours and human maintainance which adds up to significant numbers since google obliged everyone to use https no matter what (or else your website would disappear from their indexes).

we want to say NO to that, and remind everyone of the importance of minimalism everywhere. even in that S which represents stupidity more than security, for most cases (when listing cases by domain names).
