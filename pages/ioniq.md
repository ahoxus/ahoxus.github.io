[![{{ page.image }}]({{ page.image }})](/gallery#{{ page.gallery }})

on sale from april 2021 (bought for â‚¬20.5k) in many different places, such as [[olx](https://m.olx.pt/d/anuncio/oferta-hyundai-ioniq-28kwh-full-eletric-98mm-c-7-anos-de-garantia-IDGrlQ1.html)].

"the best [[ev](/ev)] battery" on the market means:

- it's the most economic one.
- even after 5 years and over 100 thousand km, it's still at 100%.
- charges from 5 to 94 in just 40 minutes.
- drive up to 180km real scenario (vila real to coimbra), with little to worry.

see below some pictures as reference to the art we will soon make on it.
