"the best [[ev](/ev)] battery" (on the market) means:

- it's the most economic one.
- even after 5 years and over 100 thousand km, it's still at 100%.
- charges from 5 to 94 in just 40 minutes.
- drive over 180km real scenario (vila real to coimbra).

see below some reference pictures for the art we wanted to make on it.
