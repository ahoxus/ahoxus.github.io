# talk

using emails we can replace all your facebook and other such needs:

- identity: freenom for free nameserver
- site: your unique profile using [#data](#data)
- forums a mailing list using sourcehut
- messengers: with delta chat and jitsi (plus telegram, telephones, and voip, for ringing)
- social media: mastodon, scuttlebutt
- irc: much better with forums and messengers

# data

using [#**magict**](#origin) scripts with termux, git and rsync, we replace most of your google/microsoft needs:

- files: nextcloud, git, and/or rsync
- photos: magict to reduce older unselected photos size periodically on files
- music: any radio app? TK
- videos: magict plus lbry? TK
- office: nextcloud and libre office? docs, sheets and slides TK
- server: bobcares from digital ocean? TK netlify, any free servers, easy to migrate with magict, including dns

# money

- ledger: need something better than budget bakers wallet TK
- bank: bitcoin, of course... good to have money, even without any need for it!

# search

this is the most complex, yet, once everything else is set, it's also the simplest one to resolve!

- google, bing: use searx instead
- pc: a #mobileofflinefirst webapp for ripgrep or lunr
