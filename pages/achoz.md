[[ahoxus](/)] helps you to reduce all your money needs down to zero.

**achoz**, by ahoxus, is a simple and free/libre open source app to organize and search through all your data offline-first (once you normalize it).

(this is another way to view the [[uproot](/uproot)] project. they're both the same).

# technical

## talk

using emails we can replace all your facebook and other such needs:

- identity: opennic for free nameserver (in the long term) or ipv6 + self hosting
- site: your unique profile using [#data](#data)
- forums: a mailing list using sourcehut + fossil-scm
- messengers: with delta chat and jitsi (plus telegram, telephones, and voip, for ringing), and perhaps briar
- social media: mastodon, scuttlebutt
- irc: much better with forums and messengers

## data

using [#**magict**](#origin) scripts with termux, git and rsync, we replace most of your google/microsoft needs:

- files: syncthing, nextcloud, fossil, and/or rsync
- photos: magict to reduce older unselected photos size periodically on files
- music: any radio app? TK
- videos: magict plus lbry? TK
- office: nextcloud and libre office? docs, sheets and slides TK
- server: tilde clubs? TK netlify? anyway, any free servers work, easy to migrate with magict, including dns

## money

- ledger: from linux. with cone.
- bank: bitcoin, of course... good to have money, even without any need for it!

## search

this is the most complex, yet, once everything else is set, it's also the simplest one to resolve!

- google, bing: use searx instead. or duck.
- pc: a #mobileofflinefirst webapp for lunr or meili, plus ripgrepall
