> a long time ago a big kid, aH, was eating cereals on a bowl, sitting silent on a chair, contemplating the sunrise.
> 
> there were buildings everywhere. the sun felt warm, mixed up with the cool morning breeze.
> 
> suddenly, aH saw another kid, oX, brooming the floor and frowning and buffing, mostly looking down.
> 
> as soon as they looked at each other in the eyes, from distance, and oX looked away, aH felt a lightning bolt jolting through the lower back spine. aH instantly yelled an almost silent and deep roar, and lost all the air in the lungs with the deadly and paralyzing pain.
> 
> exactly 1 minute later, [TK](#1-minute)
> 
> oX came to join aH around. brought a chair and the broom, then sat beside aH. without ever looking at aH's direction, oX put the broom beside aH and mumbles something. aH couldn't hear it.
> 
> aH continued to be in pain and without air. unable to move. holding the spoon. still.
> 
> oX moved away without ever looking at aH. picked up the broom and left the chair there.
> 
> about 7 minutes later, [TK](#7-minutes)
> 
> the pain haven't left aH yet, who was standing there without any movement. oX came back, even more annoyed than before, feeling completely ignored during all this time.
> 
> and then oX saw aH. noticed the stillness. but was still noticeably angry in the voice:
> 
> \- are you ok?
> 
> aH just nodded with the head.

> [TK](#continuing)

# continuing

below there was the previous text/content, which needs to be elaborated and improved like the one above.

> *now worried about the weird deadly pain, they went to seek help. took a long path over the mountains, to find other big kids: the medics. one looked at the injury and heard their story. then, the medic was sorry, for there was nothing the medics could do. then the medic continued to take care of other kids, who were bleeding or unconscious*

> *aH was, after all, basically recovered by the time it took to get to the medic. but the pain was real. and so was the invisible internal scar...*

# 1 minute

there was definitely a very short, but significant, time elapsed between the bolt event and the first oX approximation attempt.

a very short time passage here might be filled with a side story: from the past or future, or ideally by an atomic and present representation of it, in which oX was otherwise happy with the situation and looking into aH's eyes with joy.

# 7 minutes

nothing like this ever happened during the 7 years before, since they've been together. their union was nothing like a marriage, but it kind of slowly turned into a conventional one, in which they distance themselves from each other.

the exact time passing is very relevant not just because of the coincidence for the side story in same number of years, but also because that's how long it took for the pain to fade enough for a conversation to happen.
