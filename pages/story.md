# the big kid

> a long time ago a big kid, aH, was playing around and chasing a beautiful butterfly on the sunrise.

> suddenly, aH saw another kid, oX, doing some chores, annoyed, and felt the back as if hit by a lightning bolt. aH felt on the ground, in a deadly pain with an almost silent and deep roar.

> oX, who was annoyed by something, came around, saw aH on the floor, remembered how sometimes aH just lay down there, and complained something to aH then moved away, annoyed for getting no answer. after a while oX came back and finally noticed aH was seriously injured.

> now worried about the weird deadly pain, they went to seek help. took a long path over the mountains, to find other big kids: the medics. one looked at the injury and heard their story. then, the medic was sorry, for there was nothing the medics could do. then the medic continued to take care of other kids, who were bleeding or unconscious.

> aH was, after all, basically recovered by the time it took to get to the medic. but the pain was real. and so was the invisible internal scar...

ahoxus was born after the real story on which this little tale is based; on aH, oX and their friends' quest to heal and discover ways for others to follow the same steps.

after all, isn't that the same story for everyone?
