> a long time ago a big kid, aH, was eating cereals on a bowl, sitting silent on a chair, contemplating the sunrise.
> 
> there were buildings everywhere. the sun felt warm, mixed up with the cool morning breeze. the corn flakes with sugar and soy milk gives an unfamiliar taste aH got used to, of industrialised convenience with a little bit of the so called healthy food. it feels great!
> 
> suddenly, aH saw another kid, oX, brooming the floor and frowning and buffing, mostly looking down.
> 
> as soon as they looked at each other in the eyes, from distance, and oX looked away, aH felt a lightning bolt jolting through the lower back spine. aH instantly yelled an almost silent and deep roar, and lost all the air in the lungs with the deadly and paralyzing pain.
> 
> just 14 minutes before, oX remembers, they both were talking and laughing in harmony. it's not even important what was being said. the feeling of mutual enjoyment was very vivid. what could have happened in such a short time that aH started to not only be so selfish, but also stated to ignore oX obvious actions of a common annoying chore that needed to be done, as if it was all good? it wasn't all good!
> 
> oX's daydreaming ends. 1 minute have elapsed since the jolting.
> 
> oX came to join aH around. brought a chair and the broom, then sat beside aH. without ever looking at aH's direction, oX put the broom beside aH and mumbles something. aH couldn't hear it.
> 
> aH continued to be in pain and without air. unable to move. holding the spoon. still.
> 
> oX moved away without ever looking at aH. picked up the broom and left the chair there.
> 
> about 7 minutes later, flashback [TK](#7-minutes)
> 
> the pain haven't left aH yet, who was standing there without any movement. oX came back, even more annoyed than before, feeling completely ignored during all this time.
> 
> and then oX saw aH. noticed the stillness. but was still noticeably angry in the voice:
> 
> \- are you ok?
> 
> aH just nodded with the head.
> 
> [TK](#continuing)

# continuing

below there was the previous text/content, which needs to be elaborated and improved like the one above. [TK](#edited)

> *now worried about the weird deadly pain, they went to seek help. took a long path over the mountains, to find other big kids: the medics. one looked at the injury and heard their story. then, the medic was sorry, for there was nothing the medics could do. then the medic continued to take care of other kids, who were bleeding or unconscious*

> *aH was, after all, basically recovered by the time it took to get to the medic. but the pain was real. and so was the invisible internal scar...*

# 7 minutes

nothing like this ever happened during the 7 years before, since they've been together.

this flashback should be about past and future moments, without a clear distinction.

it's important to distinguish the first flashback time elapsed from this one: it took a short time for oX to first approach and a much longer time to realise what happened.
