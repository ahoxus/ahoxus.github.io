# search
in fact, the whole project is focused on this above all! we call this point of view [[achoz](/achoz)].

- search through emails together with files
- search your files faster than the web, even offline
- get a copy of our guides to search them offline if needed
- also search through wikipedia and much more!

# email
reliable services and practices:

- basic spam filtering
- unsubscribe from emails you don't read
- backup emails on your devices and multiple online hosts, using nextcloud

# file
redundancy and indexing:

- multiple hosts, multiple devices, using nextcloud
- delete or compress big files
- special plans for videos or images (not included in the free plan)

# guides
deleting is as essential as saving:

- how to delete google, facebook, and every closed source that hinders your personal freedom.
- links and instructions to many feature-full solutions that already exist today, such as delta chat and mastodon.

# pricing
3 simple options:

**self-hosted** all powers and responsibilities in your hands. free.

since everything is open source, you can just copy it, tweak at will, and use it.

**free plan** hosted with us for selected members.

storage space will be much less than most services, but still plenty for a fair usage without big media ( images, audio, video, etc).

[[subscribe](/#subscribe)] for a better chance of [[joining](/join)] the beta release.

**donate** to fairly extend the limits imposed by free services.

the sky is the new limit.

# support
premium support for everyone means human responses in less than 2 days and average in less than 2 hours.

# safe
the ultimate security is very simple to achieve:

- backup. redundancy. in your end. in multiple hosts. as much as you can afford with time, money, or whatever resources you've got.
- encryption helps to keep abusers out and prevent things like spam and scams.
- information and hints placed when needed helps you to remember what matters when needed.
- legally, there are no warranties. in practice, you'll be your own and ultimate safety net and able to never lose or be unable to find your own data again!
