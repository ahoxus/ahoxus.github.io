[![{{ page.image }}]({{ page.image }})](/gallery#{{ page.gallery }})

simply put: i've tried 5 different devices:

- 2 hotspots at around 50eur each

- 2 mobile phones from 200 to 900 EUR

- 1 mobile router stand 70eur

all the best i could find on local stores.

they all give some internet, but never as good or stable as it is just 50m away, in a clear line of sight (nothing special, but see the photo).

looks like the solution will be in importing a 150 or perhaps 350 EUR router...

more details soon, after we try it or find a better solution!
