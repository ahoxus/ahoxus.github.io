# {{ page.description }}

here's an idea. to be discussed and thought through together.

we are accepting 10 new members. this campaign will last for a short period and it'll only move forward if we get the new members.

we want people who are ready to shift their world and live with us for 1 year. read everything here. talk to us. act by yourself.

it's a project being made from scratch, now entering phase 1 of execution. this includes cooperating to flourish an integrated living and following our [core values](/core). all in portugal's countryside 10ha of land.

at first, it'll not be self-sustainable, so we will build it all. the daily cost, we calculate as something that might start as low as 10 euros. all basic needs are covered, such as water, food, electricity, and internet.

with as little as 5k eur we can help you to purchase and install your mobile home in our land. you can then move it out to anywhere you want. it's your home!

when the project hits phase 2 and becomes completely self-sustainable, we'll add an option for visitors at 20 eur for at least 1 week. the income will go to the community and may be shared among members.

those daily costs can be further reduced, depending on how much value you can bring. everyone will be required to live and work in the community. kitchen. garden. composting. maintenance in general. an equivalent shift of up to 4h per day, average. 20h per week. but we don't really think in those terms, as you'll learn...

doing the math, you can easily retire within our lifestyle. in an analogy-estimate, with just 60k in your pocket, you can pay for at least 10 years of life.

as soon as we assemble the new members we probably should crowdfund (among us or elsewhere) to build the kitchen, some compost toilets, and a hot shower, for instance. these mustn't cost more than 5k all together if we build them ourselves.

no smokers. zero tolerance in this phase. it's essential for security against wood fire, in portugal.

only organic material is allowed to go in the land, from cosmetics to paint and anything that may quickly leak underground.

recapitulating the main points:

- be #readytoshift and act fast.

- bring your home.

- get at least 3650 eur ready for minimal costs over 1 year.

- no smoking.

- only organic.

- pay attention to all details.

- come enjoy life with all its potential and in harmony!
