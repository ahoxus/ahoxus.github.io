> we share whatever we learn from our own crisis preparation, while living life with joy and without money!

is [this answer](https://frontier.pioneer.app/posts/24e9f43a-what-are-you-building-in-a-sentence) clear enough? üòÅ

we've been using pioneer gamified system to get some feedback since 2019. [the latest iterations are printed on google drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1T7fdo8RcTgne0HlwyJLbMnqTcf1nRivp).

however, we're not a "startup", by any measure. please, keep this in mind. that's also why we decided to make this page as a landing place (mostly for the pioneer community).

we are building some projects that are like that. [sanflowers](/sanflowers), for instance, can hardly not fit the book.

but ahoxus isn't that.

sit back. take a deep breath. imagine you just stumbled on something randomly.

and enjoy!

if you still want to read more about *common points we get raised by the pioneer community*:

- perhaps the most common feedback we get on pioneer: **confusing, too much text, looks like a blog, can't understand this or that, etc.** if you're considering to add in that pool, by all means, do it! it's still good feedback. but, if you're aware it's the most common, perhaps you can get creative... üòÅ

- we also get some people wondering how they could actually move towards their own "ahoxus"... to that, we have every intention to help. for now: just get in touch and ask! spoilers: it's very hard and that's why we couldn't put any guide online yet.

- "call to action". pioneer folks are eager for one. sometimes we have one, like the hope for people to join us. but, since this is not selling you anything, the main call to action in this context will always actually be along the lines of ***stop. breath. meditate.***. we don't need you to do anything for us. start with you. focus on the present moment. believe it or not, that's all we want from most people who visit the website!

- some people do understand it and even say "it's very clearly written". here's one feedback from middle june 2020: *‚ÄúGreat progress since I last encountered your project (about 4 months ago!). I suggest having a visual timeline on your homepage that shows where you are and what you've done since 2019. A visual timeline for a long term project like yours will serve as motivation to beat the timeline. Good job!‚Äù*

- right now (in 2020) we do want to reach just a few people (10 to move in, for instance). reaching too many people would make us unable to respond to everyone. so it's also good that we don't have too much input.

- using our current limited resources to increase reach too much can hinder our development by a lot!

please continue to take it slow and move forward to [the landing page](/).

and thank you so much for doing so! üòò
