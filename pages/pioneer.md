on early november we stopped updating this very page. 

the [[uproot](/uproot)] project is now the focus for pioneer. much more well suited for this task!

[![{{ page.image }}]({{ site.image_path }}{{ page.image }})](/gallery#{{ page.image }})

# [{{ page.description }}](https://frontier.pioneer.app/posts/24e9f43a-what-are-you-building-in-a-sentence)

> a disroot alternative to degoogle and a true story about our crisis-prepared life style moving to the country side. cheap and convenient.

# but what kind of story? and what crisis?

a collaborative, free, and online [story](/story) (kind of like an e-book) based on many kinds of content, such as manifestos like this very page.

and yes, most of us are living a broken life in a world filled with crisis much beyond the covid-19!

but there are other options.

# tell me more!

this is our path. we truly hope it can serve you well. üòÑ

and you should, at any time, skip to a link that might entice you to learn more. such as for reading about our [[core](/core)] values.

# some history

we've been using pioneer gamified system to be accountable and get feedback, since 2019. 

the first iterations are registered on [*google drive*](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1T7fdo8RcTgne0HlwyJLbMnqTcf1nRivp). 

since early june 2020 you can [find them on frontier]({{ page.frontier }}) by following the chain (under the comments). 

pioneer is basically a startup accelerator.

we do build some startup projects, such as [sanflowers](/sanflowers) for instance.

however, ahoxus is not a "startup", by any measure.

sit back.

take a deep breath.

imagine you just stumbled here randomly/serendipitously.

# common points raised on pioneer updates

- perhaps the most common feedback we get on pioneer: **confusing, too much text, looks like a blog, can't understand this or that, etc.**. yes, it is. even after 1 year of improving it.

- we also get some people wondering how they could actually move towards their own "ahoxus"... to that, we have every intention to help. for now: just get in touch and ask! spoilers: it's very hard and that's why we couldn't put any guide online yet. even doing syntropic agroforestry (ernst gotsch), which should be simple and taught in pre schooling, is rather complex and plain hard to begin with.

- "call to action". pioneer folks are eager for one. sometimes we have one, like the hope for people to join us. but, since this is not selling you anything, the main call to action will probably always be along the lines of ***stop. breath. meditate. think. read.***. we don't need you to do anything for us. start with you. focus on the present moment. that's all we want from most people who visit the website!

- some people do understand it and even say "it's very clearly written". here's one feedback from middle june 2020: *‚ÄúGreat progress since I last encountered your project (about 4 months ago!). I suggest having a visual timeline on your homepage that shows where you are and what you've done since 2019. A visual timeline for a long term project like yours will serve as motivation to beat the timeline. Good job!‚Äù*

- right now (in 2020) we do want to reach people personally (10 to move in, for instance). but just a few. reaching too many people would make us unable to respond to everyone. so it's also good that we don't have too much input, so...

- ... using our current limited resources to increase reach too much can hinder our development by a lot!

please continue to take it slow and move forward to [the general landing page](/).

and thank you so much for doing so! üòò
