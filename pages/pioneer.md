# {{ page.description }}

we've been using pioneer gamified system to get some feedback since 2019. [here are the latest iterations](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1T7fdo8RcTgne0HlwyJLbMnqTcf1nRivp).

however, we're not your usual "startup", by any measure. please, keep this in mind. that's also why we decided to make this page as a landing place for pioneer community.

if you come here with that startup mindset, more things to keep in mind:

- perhaps the most common feedback we get from pioneer community: **confusing, too much text, looks like a blog, etc.** if you're considering to add in that pool, by all means, do it! it's still good feedback. but, if you're aware it's the most common, perhaps you can get creative... üòÅ

- we also get some wondering how they could actually move towards their own "ahoxus"... to that, we have every intention to help. for now: just get in touch and ask! spoilers: it's very hard and that's why we couldn't put any guide online yet.

- some people do understand it and even say "it's very clearly written". here's one feedback from middle june 2020: *‚ÄúGreat progress since I last encountered your project (about 4 months ago!). I suggest having a visual timeline on your homepage that shows where you are and what you've done since 2019. A visual timeline for a long term project like yours will serve as motivation to beat the timeline. Good job!‚Äù*

- right now (in 2020) we do want to reach just a few people (10 to move in, for instance). reaching too many people would make us unable to respond to everyone. so it's also good that we don't have too much input.

- using our current limited resources to increase reach too much can hinder our development by a lot!

please continue to take it slow and move forward to [the landing page](/).

and thank you so much for doing so! üòò
