if you don't need sleep accommodations and food, or you bring your own, **just come**! also, there are restaurants in a 5km radius.

it is recommended to arrange a date in advance if you also want to meet someone. for that, just:

- [get in touch](/contact)! (before comming)

then, see the directions and come.

- [map](/map)

for now, you can see everything there's to expect on arriving here at airbnb. it's an unreleased project right now, and a good "standardized" (as much as possible) way to present the space: keep in mind we don't offer a typical "bed and breakfast", or even a typical wild camping but it's quite enough if you're very adventurous!

finally, you may also consider to [join our work force](/join).

we love visitors. remember to [breath](/breath) come and see for yourself! ðŸ¥°
