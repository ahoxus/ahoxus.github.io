if you don't need sleep accommodations and food, or you bring your own, just come! also, there are restaurants in a 5km radius.

it is recommended to arrange a date in advance if you also want to meet someone. for that, just [get in touch](/contact)!

then, see [the directions](/map) and come.

for now, you can see everything there's to expect on arrival at [airbnb](https://airbnb.com/h/ahoxus) (it's an unreleased thing we're planning there). we don't offer a typical "bed and breakfast", or even a typical wild camping, you should know, but it's quite enough of you're very adventurous!

and we love visitors! ðŸ¥°
