[![{{ page.image }}]({{ page.image }})](/gallery#{{ page.gallery }})

if you don't need sleep accommodations and food, or you bring your own, **just come**!

there are a few restaurants in a 5km radius. we recommend "sabores da aldeia", near the aerodromo small airport.

we also recommend to arrange a date in advance if you want to meet someone. for that, just:

- [get in touch](/contact)! (before comming)

be aware we love to have long conversations and [play games](https://talk.ahoxus.org/notice/AGhOzl1NL1W1aYJ36u#arthur#challenge).

finally, here you can see the directions and come visit!

- [map](/map)

for now, you can see some (outdated) things to expect on arriving here at airbnb, an unreleased project (we don't offer a typical "bed and breakfast", or even a typical wild camping but you may find it quite enough if you're very adventurous!).

- [more details (temporarily) on airbnb](https://airbnb.com/h/ahoxus)

finally, you may also consider to [join our "work" force](/join) or simply [[staying](/stay)] for some time.

we love visitors. remember to [breath](/breath), come, and see for yourself! ðŸ¥°
