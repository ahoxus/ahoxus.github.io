hi, how are you?

would you want to share your ride with me, to anywhere? 😁

[i'm](//cregox.net/who) always going somewhere...

in here i intended to share where to, when hitchhiking.

but i never really did it.

you could've see [past attempts on the source's history](https://github.com/ahoxus/ahoxus.github.io/commits/master/pages/c/x.md) if i ever did it.
