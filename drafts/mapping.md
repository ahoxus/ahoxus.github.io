# did you mean [[map](/map)]

# {{ page.description }}

![{{ page.image }}]({{ page.image }})

<!--
[![{{ page.image }}]({{ page.image }})](/gallery#{{ page.gallery }})

we have an [outdated draft on google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oD_ZEIF3SL2baKvtiIj-mbaA6le-qL21iEue_QpIg6g/edit?usp=drivesdk) mapping of our own...

but there are also at least 2 other interesting portugal maps out there:

- [catalise](https://redeconvergir.net/catalise)

- [rede convergir](https://redeconvergir.net/)

they're actually linked to each other and both have a similar approach of how we wanted to map the alternatives.
