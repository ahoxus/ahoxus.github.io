    <title>What do I need to learn in order to become an artificial intelligence researcher? logic + philosophy + arts</title>

    <description>originally [written on quora](https://www.quora.com/What-do-I-need-to-learn-in-order-to-research-artificial-intelligence/answer/Caue-Rego) yet another &quot;self help&quot; thought:

[quote]
scientifically I&#39;d say you could think of Ai with 3 axis: _logic_, _philosophy_ and _arts_.

_(if this answer gets enough interest I&#39;ll expand more)_

**logic**
that&#39;s the binary world, the same one that constructs math and progamming*. you can&#39;t have any kind of intelligence without a solid logic.

**philosophy**
this is the spiritual world, looked upon mostly through logic (i.e. with much intelligence).

**arts**
materialization. Ai is a lot about ideas but nothing of that matters if you can&#39;t bring it to the real world. making a spam filter out of pure logic is an awesome piece art and, make no mistake, programming is a form of art! ;)

---

there really is nothing in your life you can&#39;t use to learn about researching for Ai, specially if you&#39;re talking about the tech singularity. **anything works**.

now, if all you want is weak Ai, the one being sold today, you can leave **philosophy** behind and focus most your efforts in **logic** and, if you&#39;re lucky enough, make tons of money with it, with a good enough **art**. just keep in mind money isn&#39;t everything - it&#39;s just 1/3 of it.
