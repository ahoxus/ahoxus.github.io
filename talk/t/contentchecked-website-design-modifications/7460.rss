Hey Caue - 

I apologise for such a belated response, we are at a very busy time in our company development and I was unable to repsond quickly to your creation. We were not impressed with the site that you had provided and as a result we are no longer pursuing your services. It was not delivered punctually and it was not what we had envisioned. Aside from that , you are a promising developper I am sure, I hope that you have success on your next venture.

              <p>Maybe we're not communicating properly here.</p>

<p>Reading again our conversations, I think I could have, completely
unintentionally, led you to believe <em>I was a designer</em>. I'm only a
<strong>Computer Engineer</strong>.</p>

<p>I even created this <a href="http://cregox.com/your-home">web page</a>, which
unfortunatelly I didn't link you before, precisely to prevent such
confusions. And that's also why I'm making *all my support tickets public
from now on* (moving away from zendesk). **I want to make it very clear who
I am and what I do.**</p>

<p>You have every right to be unsatisfied with my job, but we need to clear up
2 points from your message:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>My due date was Feb 24 and I delivered it on Feb 24.</p></li>
<li><p>We have long discussions and pictures of what you wanted, and it is all
<a href="https://cregox-contentchecked.squarespace.com">there</a> (at least for a few
more days), working as requested, since Feb 24.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>After this experience, I've came to learn this simple and fair way to do
business, in which both sides have to commit. Half payment upfront.</p>

<p>I hope hearing from you and getting to a mutual agreement for my payment
and your delivery, reaching a satisfying result for both sides.</p>
