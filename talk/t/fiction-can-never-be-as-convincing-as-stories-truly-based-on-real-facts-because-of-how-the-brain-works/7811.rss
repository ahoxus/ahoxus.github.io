Not sure if this fits better under [social](/c/social) or [tech](/c/tech). It&#39;s sure about *my* perceived **science**.

By re-reading that post, I thought it would fit better here in [buffer](/c/buffer) given its size. But, instead of moving it I decided to just clarify it and link here, with a more descriptive title. :)</description>

  <blockquote>( edited for more clarity ) 

also, for context, I wrote the post while I was very inspired and <a href="/talk/t/two-weeks-i-havent-updated-the-novel-any-ideas-or-feedback-anyone/7806">writing the 3 novel chapters</a> that will probably not get any bigger unless people manifest themselves. 

since then, I've also added a buffer post about this. 

novels, being a creation of human imagination, and the hugely flawed human brain, have no validation on the much bigger REAL UNIVERSE, the one and only, basiux's true GOD (church of tech's god is basiux, but basiux's god is the universe). 

yesâ€¦
