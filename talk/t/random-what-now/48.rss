    <title>Random what now?</title>
    <link>http://talk.cregox.com/t/random-what-now/48</link>
    <description>A series of 2 great recent videos summarize very well a lot of what I was trying to write about what I think of determinism. [What is Random?][1] and [What is NOT Random?][2]

But one of them comes to the conclusion the universe isn&#39;t deterministic simply by looking at its entropy as we know today. While I think the 4 dimensional universe usually credited as Einstein&#39;s idea sounds bogus, I agree with him: the universe must be deterministic. Or, as he said it &quot;*God does not play dice*&quot;. This is one of my hard faith beliefs.

10 years ago I&#39;ve completely changed my faith pillars such as this one, and when it happened I also felt one of the best feelings I&#39;ve ever did. Changing the root beliefes, unlike many fear, is quite pleasurable. I&#39;m not sure if it helped me much or not, I&#39;m not where I&#39;d like to be today, so maybe I do need a new brain format... But this isn&#39;t it. It&#39;s very very far from it, in fact.

[I wrote a blog post about this very subject a few months ago][3], but I was trying to polish it better. Re-reading it now I see I could do it simply by removing some negativity I was adding in the end. Maybe the videos helped me realizing that...

So, what&#39;s the point of all this? Well, if you believe the universe isn&#39;t deterministic and that God does play dices, then all we can do is hope and have faith in randomness. Maybe that&#39;s why I choose to believe otherwise, that way if only for a fraction of second we can determine what&#39;s going to happen to 1 single person in 1 single time in the future, to me, that&#39;d be the most satisfying achievements of all. It&#39;s either possible to do it or impossible, right? I believe this is possible even if not in my lifetime.
