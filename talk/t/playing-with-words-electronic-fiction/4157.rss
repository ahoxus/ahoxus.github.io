    <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I&#39;ve got 2 main projects I&#39;m investing my time on. The &lt;em&gt;school&lt;/em&gt;, and the one I used to call &quot;ants&quot;, because &quot;food seekers&quot; were too big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1413999897087_54147&quot;&gt;I&#39;m interpolating back and forth between them and, except for the next week, I&#39;ll probably go back now to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cregox.com/efi&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;/efi&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e-Fi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; one. This is a phun on sci-Fi, indeed, but it also has everything to do with the project. It&#39;s like a sci-Fi by all means, but it&#39;s also playable... Only electronically, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1413999897087_53600&quot;&gt;After studying it and trying to apply it, I&#39;ve realized the &lt;em&gt;school&lt;/em&gt; is not a sustainable business in a short term and, as such, I came to think maybe it&#39;s better going back to the one I love the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1413999897087_47633&quot;&gt;I do have currently a few paying students, closeby friends, with private classes, who enjoy it. And I am going to move it forward, such as always trying to improve the material. But for now I won&#39;t personally try to market it for new people and I won&#39;t try right now to make a mvp either for bigger classes or some kind of mooc online course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1413999897087_48265&quot;&gt;Instead, I&#39;m thinking in making the e-Fi, themed with the course. If I can make it fun, of course. If not, I&#39;ll fall back to &lt;em&gt;food seekers, &lt;/em&gt;which is much easier to come up with a fun storyline, and it&#39;s still possible to add a few concepts there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1413999897087_49368&quot;&gt;Well, that&#39;s it. This is just a short &quot;announcement&quot; (in case there&#39;s anyone other than me reading this)! A kind of mark I like to add for myself and later consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
