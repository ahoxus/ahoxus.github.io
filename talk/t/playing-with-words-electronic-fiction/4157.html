<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1413999897087_54147">I'm interpolating back and forth between them and, except for the next week, I'll probably go back now to the <a href="http://www.cregox.com/efi" data-cke-saved-href="/efi"><strong>e-Fi</strong></a> one. This is a phun on sci-Fi, indeed, but it also has everything to do with the project. It's like a sci-Fi by all means, but it's also playable... Only electronically, unfortunately.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1413999897087_53600">After studying it and trying to apply it, I've realized the <em>school</em> is not a sustainable business in a short term and, as such, I came to think maybe it's better going back to the one I love the most.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1413999897087_47633">I do have currently a few paying students, closeby friends, with private classes, who enjoy it. And I am going to move it forward, such as always trying to improve the material. But for now I won't personally try to market it for new people and I won't try right now to make a mvp either for bigger classes or some kind of mooc online course.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1413999897087_48265">Instead, I'm thinking in making the e-Fi, themed with the course. If I can make it fun, of course. If not, I'll fall back to <em>food seekers, </em>which is much easier to come up with a fun storyline, and it's still possible to add a few concepts there.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1413999897087_49368">Well, that's it. This is just a short "announcement" (in case there's anyone other than me reading this)! A kind of mark I like to add for myself and later consideration.</p>
