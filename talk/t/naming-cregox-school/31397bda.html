        <blockquote><span>The background picture contains both one of the first things we learn to name (house) and a place I'd like the school to be (in a castle) :P</span></blockquote>
<p>Recently <a href="http://directory.calarts.edu/node/12810">a friend</a> who was interested in <a href="http://www.cregox.com/learn">learning IT</a> (more specifically programming in a particular language, called Processing) brought this book to my attention: <em><a href="http://natureofcode.com/book/">Nature of Code</a></em>, as a reference to what he was studying, and asked me what I think.</p>
<p>I replied to him I think the book has a terrible name. It should be called something like "<em>Nature of Processing Code</em>". It's still an ambiguous name, but at least it would bring the book's main topic in its name: a programming language called Processing.</p>
<p>Why are names so important?</p>
<p>I believe naming is the most important aspect of any language (there's probably a TED talk for that). We can only construct any rational thought after learning names. Every single word we use to communicate is in fact a name of some thing.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.britishcouncil.org/2013/10/02/why-everyone-should-learn-1000-words-in-another-language/">Some studies reveal</a> learning a language is simply a matter of learning words in it. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5962099/memorize-the-1000-most-common-words-in-a-language-before-immersing-yourself-in-it">Starting at around 1000 words</a> you can begin to communicate pretty well - no need for grammar, verb tenses, etc. Also one could argue the main goal in living is naming things.</p>
<p>Usually programmers will ignore this. We need to give names to a lot of things. But often we use "x", "foo" or whatever non-descriptive name. We rationalize it's because it's irrelevant to give a proper name. Or maybe we think it should be obvious by its functionality, or it doesn't matter, or we need to save space to reduce file size / lines of code / counting of letters. This bad naming brings high costs down the road... But that's a whole other subject. Suffice to say for now, always give good names.</p>
<p>This is the subject of the first topic in any class I'd give relating to computers or languages.</p>
<p>Short post today. :)</p>
