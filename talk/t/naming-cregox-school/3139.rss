    <title>Naming cregox school</title>
    <link>http://talk.cregox.com/t/naming-cregox-school/3139</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;The background picture contains both one of the first things we learn to name (house) and a place I&#39;d like the school to be (in a castle) :P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://directory.calarts.edu/node/12810&quot;&gt;a friend&lt;/a&gt; who was interested in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cregox.com/learn&quot;&gt;learning IT&lt;/a&gt; (more specifically programming in a particular language, called Processing) brought this book to my attention: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://natureofcode.com/book/&quot;&gt;Nature of Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, as a reference to what he was studying, and asked me what I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I replied to him I think the book has a terrible name. It should be called something like &quot;&lt;em&gt;Nature of Processing Code&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. It&#39;s still an ambiguous name, but at least it would bring the book&#39;s main topic in its name: a programming language called Processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are names so important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe naming is the most important aspect of any language (there&#39;s probably a TED talk for that). We can only construct any rational thought after learning names. Every single word we use to communicate is in fact a name of some thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually programmers will ignore this. We need to give names to a lot of things. But often we use &quot;x&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or whatever non-descriptive name. We rationalize it&#39;s because it&#39;s irrelevant to give a proper name. Or maybe we think it should be obvious by its functionality, or it doesn&#39;t matter, or we need to save space to reduce file size / lines of code / counting of letters. This bad naming brings high costs down the road... But that&#39;s a whole other subject. Suffice to say for now, always give good names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the subject of the first topic in any class I&#39;d give relating to computers or languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short post today. :)&lt;/p&gt;
