Hey there,
I found you listed as developers for squarespace and wanted to see if you
would have any interest in helping us out. We have an online store looking
for a solution to have gift card support in squarespace.

As you might know squarespace only has coupon support and a true gift card
functionality is not available. Do you have any ideas how to have a
workaround that would support :
- checkout with a unique coupon that covers price of product and shipping.
i.e. 39+5$
- automated way of selling a gift card on the same store, so no manual
labor is needed.

Cheers and let me know your thoughts on this and possible timeline/pricing.

              <p>I'm not very familiar with squarespace coupons, but squarespace doesn't really allow for much customization of the commerce. I did manage, for instance, to <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/adding-a-shopping-cart-limitation-with-a-warning-message/7504">add a limiting checkout for another customer</a>, but that was a minor modification. You can see it at work on <a href="http://cregox.com/shop">my shop test</a>.</p>

<p>I could probably make something similar for your first request, but the coupon codes would have to be manually added on the advanced code injection script, which wouldn't be too hard...</p>

<p>The problem there is automating anything. I'm really not sure what you mean there, by "no manual labor" and all, but I find it really hard to automate whatever with such a closed system as this squarespace commerce unfortunately is.</p>

<p>In any case, here there are 2 alternatives I haven't tried, that may suit you: <a href="https://answers.squarespace.com/questions/17702/can-i-sell-and-use-gift-cards-with-squarespace-commerce">https://answers.squarespace.com/questions/17702/can-i-sell-and-use-gift-cards-with-squarespace-commerce</a></p>

<p>Also I did notice <a href="http://jasonbarone.com/">Jason Barone</a> asked that question over 1 year ago. <strong>Maybe</strong> he managed to develop something ( if you do go to him and find out a solution, please let me know! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue" width="20" height="20"> ).</p>

<p>I could <a href="http://developers.squarespace.com/search">find nothing on the developer docs</a> to support this would be possible there. I still didn't have the opportunity to go on developer mode, but as far as I can tell, it's only good for customizing templates and it gives just slightly more and still much limited access to the locked in squarespace backend data.</p>

<p>I feel like your best bet will probably be going with <a href="http://www.GiftFly.com">www.GiftFly.com</a> like <em>tashography</em> pointed in <a href="http://answers.squarespace.com/questions/17702/can-i-sell-and-use-gift-cards-with-squarespace-commerce/60264">that answer</a>:</p>
