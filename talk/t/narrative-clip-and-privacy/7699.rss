I probably have some considerable level of [autism][2], although I don&#39;t recall ever doing any repetitive stacking out of coding universe.

Yesterday I went to &quot;[Coro da Achada][3]&quot; for the second time. **Lovely** place, despite being too politic to my taste. During the weekly rehearsals, at least the ones I were there, nobody really talks about any politics, so fine by me as I really, really rather focus on what matters to me: science and arts! :)

That&#39;s subject to a whole other topic, so, anyway...

It is a very open place. Anyone can come in, join and sign. Enjoy. I think I&#39;ll even play with then on a presentation next Saturday, even being such a fresh newbie. It will be awesome (I hope)!

The songs are mostly cheerful, despite of the focus being &quot;**politics intervention**&quot;, as they say. I&#39;ve got little clue of what that means. The first time I thought &quot;politics, I better stay out&quot;. Now I thought &quot;well, maybe this makes sense to me if the intervention is to add science!&quot;. One can only dream.

Maybe one day, since people there are so nice, if I stick around enough, we can even sign about [basiux][4]! :D

July, 27th a sunny Monday, that&#39;s one of the most common kinds of pictures along with my first &quot;outdoors&quot; one with [the clip (karma referral link)][5].

Since then I&#39;ve been using it almost every day. Some people asked me &quot;what&#39;s that?&quot;, I answered &quot;it&#39;s narrative clip, takes 2 pictures per minute&quot;. Now I&#39;ve updated to &quot;1 picture every 10 seconds&quot;. Yesterday I was surprised with the first bad reaction, and a massive one. They really wanted to convince me I was doing something wrong and wrong. I couldn&#39;t understand what was so wrong about it.

So I researched, just now, briefly. Found [this][6]:smile:

&gt; ## Common Sense For Wearing/Not Wearing The Narrative Clip

&gt; &lt;small&gt;June 11, 2015 23:11&lt;/small&gt;

&gt; Narrative’s products and services are all about integrity. Everything you create with Narrative is yours - only yours. If you want to share your content with someone else we think you should. But only you decide when to do that. 

&gt; Legally, you may photograph what you want, as long as you don’t obviously infringe someone else’s integrity or violate an official photo ban. Two things follow from this: firstly, you have extensive rights to photograph what ever you find interesting or important or beautiful or for other reason worth documenting. Secondly, you have significant responsibilities to respect other people’s integrity. If someone asks you not to use your Narrative Clip - then please don’t. If someone doesn’t explicitly ask you, but you have **reason** to believe that the place or the context is inappropriate for photographing - then please don’t. 

I&#39;ve bolded the &quot;reason&quot; there, for a reason. And this was not as helpful as I&#39;d like. Too short.

I never have reason to believe anywhere is inappropriate, specially after reading &quot;*Legally, you may photograph what you want, as long as you don’t obviously infringe someone else’s integrity or violate an official photo ban*&quot;.

What could be those reasons? **I lack common sense**. Being someone who don&#39;t believe in privacy, I don&#39;t correlate myself with many of those things. I was once very, very, very, very, **very** shy. And that&#39;s it.

About a week ago I was discussing privacy with other tech geeks, talking about firefox, passwords, tor, and digital privacy in general. One of them caught my idea of &quot;it&#39;s all about miss communication&quot; within seconds. And he kept thinking about it. And I kept thinking about how fast he got it.

My conclusion was that privacy, like vaccine, is important to those who can suffer it. You should vaccine yourself and be aware of privacy because even if it doesn&#39;t matter at all to you, it matters to some people, and it threatens their life. Not only politicians and diplomats, but whoever lives on the edge.

It is, still, all about our lack of a better protocol to communicate to each other... But, in practice, there is this very important reason for privacy. And that, somehow, is impressed in our culture. Some people care so much for it, and have no clue to why. They get in circles trying to explain. Very, very confusing.

Some of them may also be shy. Others may be wanting to control everything themselves. To me, those are childish or teenage feelings. Children aren&#39;t shy, they become when they become teens and realize the extent of their actions and how they can&#39;t control it as they wanted to. Some people grow out of shyness but keep that infamous controlling will behaviour.

I don&#39;t know what was the reason behind so many people in that group who just hated finding out I have been using a camera without their consent. I don&#39;t think they know it themselves. One of them asked me near the end of the event, and we then talked for almost 1 hour only about this, most of them angry at me at some level. Only reason we stopped was I had to go. It was 2:22 in the morning.

Worse, I still can find no reason to not try again in a similar environment, without necessarily doing what they seem to have advised, per my own suggestion: to greet myself warning people. &quot;*Hi, I&#39;m Caue and I&#39;ve got a camera.*&quot;. If I ever feel the need to greet in this way, I&#39;ll probably just silently remove the clip instead.

I may, however, never feel this need unless someone explicitly tells me to. After all, if this isn&#39;t legal, it should be.

Why do I bother? Now, that I don&#39;t know.

I do know I love using whatever technology that helps my memory, and patching the intrinsic brain malfunctions associated with it that most people don&#39;t know or like to admit it exists.

Narrative clip is still not it, but a great usage to it for instance would be remembering every single thing I ate. With the right A.I., which could come only after the singularity, it can easily lead to such a improvement leap in my own health. This may never happen, but it isn&#39;t too hard to see the benefits of [never forgetting things](http://talk.cregox.com/t/from-gods-debris-to-data-loss-why-people-love-forgetting-so-much/7750).

What are the downsides? The only one I can see is being overwhelmed, but that only happens if you still want to control everything! ;)

<blockquote><p>I believe the <em>entire story of you</em> will arrive</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>This is the only point I disagree. It won't arrive. Version 20 of narrative clip or smart glasses are nowhere near this <em>grain</em> thing, for any practical purpose. Off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li>they'd still need to be worn</li>
<li>you turn your eye to one side and the camera won't record what you saw</li>
<li>they need to be recharged</li>
<li>they need to be uploaded</li>
<li>probably the resolution for such a wide field of view will still not be as good as the eye</li>
<li>won't have that speedy access to any moment you want within 1 second, pause, and zoom within 2 seconds then back to whenever other moment</li>
</ul>

<p>Those may seem like minor details, but if the grain didn't have all of them it would be a whole completely different story. That grain zooming in alone is impossible to imagine in any near future.</p>

<p>Also, to expand the idea they are giving a terrible message, regardless if they want it or not, it's in the ending. Sure, the guy had way too many problems, but most people do have similar issues and might identify with him. The ending basically says "just remove that dreadful technology, because we can't handle it - it will turn dark and we better off without it". Okay, maybe they even knew this was not the point, as this is just fiction and they were trying to "add drama" to make it entertaining. It still does give this message, very strongly. And it is still their responsibility, whether they assume it or not.</p>

<p>You can't blame them if people want to follow that message, but you can blame them for spreading out such a bad lesson.</p>

<p>I get your point and possibly the majority of people will interpret it like that. <br>In my opinion the series doesn't want to pass any message, it is just entertainment. A dark drama series, with sci-fi as a theme, could be supernatural, criminal, war, medical. It is my belief the creators don't want to pass any judgement on technology. I can be wrong because I didn't research about their views.<br>I'm sure the same story could be told in the present, the 1950's and in biblical times, with the same dramatic effect.</p>

<p>As example, let me take a violent part of the episode where the jealous husband violently demands deletion of footage.</p>

<blockquote><p>"...and threatens to cut Jonas' grain out of his neck if he doesn't delete all the footage of her stored on it."</p></blockquote>

<p>In different times, the demand could be about burning letters and photos, or destroying an oil painting.</p>

<p>I agree with the popular view that technology in neither good or bad. Electricity, cars, airplanes, steal metal... all have good and bad uses.<br>Being against technology that lets you remember clearly what happen 3 years ago(if you wish), it is like claiming that the adoption of a writing system was bad because people can write a paper diary that mentions what themselves and other people did.<br>In a way it is positive people reflect about negative uses, well before the technology arrives (Although, in my view, most things the <em>grain</em> imply are already true for heavy users of social-media, IM and e-mail).</p>

<p>I agree it is not realistic but I look at it as artistic expression, not as a technical document.<br>I watched the <a href="https://youtu.be/8-4NVpa3m8k">White Christmas</a> episode yesterday. It has a slightly different take on AR, and <em>corrected</em> some of the flaws you noticed, but possibly made other things worst. </p>

<p>Yes, in that world only the technology evolved. Culturally people were following the <em>primitive</em> ways of 2011.<br>I believe that more widespread transparency and less room for distortion of facts, can be a key contribution to a society with less injustice and corruption. But I'm also not an extremist about it, I believe in limits and in not implementing it by brute force. It will eventually find its place naturally, like the personal computer, the cell phone and the Internet did.</p>

<p>To that I say that a version 5 of the Narrative Clip or Smart Glasses will probably have enough memory and field of view, to provide the same practical uses of the <em>grain</em>. It just won't be implanted on your head.<br>I believe the <em>entire story of you</em> will arrive before the singularity, and we will have to deal with it on our own.</p>

<p>I also forgot to link to <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/digressing-about-a-hypothetical-point-and-shoot-to-end-all-point-and-shoots/7647/1?u=cregox">my previous digression about cameras</a>...

<p>As for Black Mirror, just watched that episode. Didn't know about it, thanks for bringing it! It is very, very relevant for the rest of this post, so I'll link it again here:</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="Sw3GIR70HAY" data-youtube-title="Black Mirror S01E03 The Entire History Of You" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

<p>I really don't like such dark narratives. Life is Beautiful have one of the darkest themes ever, but a much better narrative. Perfume is dark all along, and still awesome narrative. Stranger than Fiction brings a dark theme in a fun way. They just fucked up the ending, but I bet that was due to studios. Or maybe too much american culture. I guess my point is, the narrative here is way too misleading. It says the technology is bad and should be feared. And it mustn't. <strong>That's a terrible message to pass forward</strong>.</p>

<p>That episode is, indeed, precisely what those guys feared, IMHO. And it is way too naive, intellectually speaking. That's sure something that could happen, given that technology was possible. But it was so dark due to his compulsion and the narrative, nothing else.</p>

<p>Plus, there are so many little details they get wrong, it's really hard for me to agree this would be a plausible future. It is way too far from one. There wouldn't be big screens everywhere, people would be able to show to others the same way they show on the TV, but with no need for that TV there. There's not even Augmented Reality implemented in there, insanely absurd. The remote control in that way would be impossible to be controlled as fast as they do, and it wouldn't be necessary anyway. You could insert a battery less lenses with high definition into someone's eye, and fuel it with a micro storage device into people neck, then connect those two somehow. It's an insane amount of tech there which would necessarily yield to other tech that already exist today to be well developed as well, such as direct brain communication. No freaking need for a remote control.</p>

<p>Regardless, although the world there was very well constructed, people living in such world would not behave in that way at all. Sure, the recordings are private, but why do you need to worry about privacy in a world everyone can better understand each other (thanks to science)? Privacy and "white lies" could easily be gone. Hell, with that tech, we might not need to communicate through speech. We'd have to face new and different challenges of the human nature, ones we can't predict to exist today, because that's what the brain plasticity and huge amount of genetic combinations can generate.</p>

<p>All that, of course, only if this happens before the singularity. In my mind, the tech to make this episode possible is way more advanced than reaching the singularity. Time will tell. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>I agree with you that most people can't explain why they react so badly to someone using a narrative clip or google glass.</p>

<p>To make things worst, the Portuguese law is very strict, and at the same time vague about exceptions. I couldn't find the details but I'm sure I'm breaking the law by using a dashcam in my car.<br>The law is old and makes little sense nowadays. Couldn't find anything official about using dashcams in Portugal but the law is similar to other European countries.<br>For <a href="http://www.guichet.public.lu/citoyens/fr/actualites/2014/09/25-camera-voiture/index.html">example</a> in Luxembourg.<br>The last sentence reads: "It follows from the above that the recording made ​​using a dashcam is illegal.  Failure to comply with these provisions is punishable by imprisonment and / or fines."<br>In my opinion the dashcam should be mandatory, not forbidden. <br>If someone rich and powerful crashes into my car after running a red light, and both drivers claim their light was green, guess who will be found guilty. My insurance doesn't pay me for my own damages in such circumstances and, of course, a car accident can have even worse consequences...</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Mann">Steve Mann</a>, nicknamed the father of wearables, permanently wears a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sousveillance">sousveillance</a> device.<br>I would like to be wearing a surveillance device if I'm victim of a crime, like robbery or police brutality. It is also not rare the moments when I feel my life threaten when crossing the road.</p>

<p>For these reasons, and the ones you pointed, I wish people were more tolerant to the narrative clip. I truly believe than one day it will become common practice.</p>

<p>July, 27th a sunny Monday, that's one of the most common kinds of pictures along with my first "outdoors" one with <a href="http://getnarrative.com/#/gtU6g2">the clip (karma referral link)</a>.</p>

<p>Since then I've been using it almost every day. Some people asked me "what's that?", I answered "it's narrative clip, takes 2 pictures per minute". Now I've updated to "1 picture every 10 seconds". Yesterday I was surprised with the first bad reaction, and a massive one. They really wanted to convince me I was doing something wrong and wrong. I couldn't understand what was so wrong about it.</p>

<p>So I researched, just now, briefly. Found <a href="https://support.getnarrative.com/hc/en-us/articles/202246638-Common-Sense-For-Wearing-Not-Wearing-The-Narrative-Clip?flash_digest=a95dde914d3d71728a57c3e4c2f02525aab5fb99">this</a><img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=1" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<blockquote>
<h2>Common Sense For Wearing/Not Wearing The Narrative Clip</h2>
<p><small>June 11, 2015 23:11</small></p>
<p>Narrative’s products and services are all about integrity. Everything you create with Narrative is yours - only yours. If you want to share your content with someone else we think you should. But only you decide when to do that. </p>
<p>Legally, you may photograph what you want, as long as you don’t obviously infringe someone else’s integrity or violate an official photo ban. Two things follow from this: firstly, you have extensive rights to photograph what ever you find interesting or important or beautiful or for other reason worth documenting. Secondly, you have significant responsibilities to respect other people’s integrity. If someone asks you not to use your Narrative Clip - then please don’t. If someone doesn’t explicitly ask you, but you have <strong>reason</strong> to believe that the place or the context is inappropriate for photographing - then please don’t. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've bolded the "reason" there, for a reason. And this was not as helpful as I'd like. Too short.</p>

<p>I never have reason to believe anywhere is inappropriate, specially after reading "<em>Legally, you may photograph what you want, as long as you don’t obviously infringe someone else’s integrity or violate an official photo ban</em>".</p>

<p>What could be those reasons? <strong>I lack common sense</strong>. Being someone who don't believe in privacy, I don't correlate myself with many of those things. I was once very, very, very, very, <strong>very</strong> shy. And that's it.</p>

<p>About a week ago I was discussing privacy with other tech geeks, talking about firefox, passwords, tor, and digital privacy in general. One of them caught my idea of "it's all about miss communication" within seconds. And he kept thinking about it. And I kept thinking about how fast he got it.</p>

<p>My conclusion was that privacy, like vaccine, is important to those who can suffer it. You should vaccine yourself and be aware of privacy because even if it doesn't matter at all to you, it matters to some people, and it threatens their life. Not only politicians and diplomats, but whoever lives on the edge.</p>

<p>It is, still, all about our lack of a better protocol to communicate to each other... But, in practice, there is this very important reason for privacy. And that, somehow, is impressed in our culture. Some people care so much for it, and have no clue to why. They get in circles trying to explain. Very, very confusing.</p>

<p>Some of them may also be shy. Others may be wanting to control everything themselves. To me, those are childish or teenage feelings. Children aren't shy, they become when they become teens and realize the extent of their actions and how they can't control it as they wanted to. Some people grow out of shyness but keep that infamous controlling will behaviour.</p>

<p>I don't know what was the reason behind so many people in that group who just hated finding out I have been using a camera without their consent. I don't think they know it themselves. One of them asked me near the end of the event, and we then talked for almost 1 hour only about this, most of them angry at me at some level. Only reason we stopped was I had to go. It was 2:22 in the morning.</p>

<p>Worse, I still can find no reason to not try again in a similar environment, without necessarily doing what they seem to have advised, per my own suggestion: to greet myself warning people. "<em>Hi, I'm Caue and I've got a camera.</em>". If I ever feel the need to greet in this way, I'll probably just silently remove the clip instead.</p>

<p>I may, however, never feel this need unless someone explicitly tells me to. After all, if this isn't legal, it should be.</p>

<p>Why do I bother? Now, that I don't know.</p>

<p>I do know I love using whatever technology that helps my memory, and patching the intrinsic brain malfunctions associated with it that most people don't know or like to admit it exists.</p>

<p>Narrative clip is still not it, but a great usage to it for instance would be remembering every single thing I ate. With the right A.I., which could come only after the singularity, it can easily lead to such a improvement leap in my own health. This may never happen, but it isn't too hard to see the benefits of <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/from-gods-debris-to-data-loss-why-people-love-forgetting-so-much/7750">never forgetting things</a>.</p>

<p>What are the downsides? The only one I can see is being overwhelmed, but that only happens if you still want to control everything! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=1" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
