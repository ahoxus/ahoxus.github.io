    <title>How to become a cloudfactory worker?</title>
    <link>/talk/t/how-to-become-a-cloudfactory-worker/7649</link>
    <description>This is a message to 2 science guys I&#39;ve found [there][1].

---

Found you both [through angel.co][2] in one of my serendipitous web surfing. From there I&#39;ve got to [humanoid twitter][3] and, finally, after reading the FAQ and really trying to answer this question without sending any email, I decided to find someone who could answer this question on the [cloud factory team][4] using cmd+f for &quot;science&quot;.

I&#39;m currently looking for **a job to pay my bills**, so I can [focus on my current life quest][5].

So I would like to know more on how to become a worker and what are the benefits. I read on the FAQ you are gathering nearby people from your current team (friends, family, classmates, colleagues, neighbors, etc), but **I identify so much with your idea central idea**:

&gt; Online work platform, melding human and machine intelligence. Aims to connect 1M people in the developing world to basic computer work using advanced machine learning techniques to model and predict how well individuals will perform

That&#39;s basically [the core of what I want to do, my current focus][6]. So I&#39;d be really glad if we could join forces (and me getting a job there in the process) ;P
