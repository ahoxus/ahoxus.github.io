    <title>About the Free Goodies category</title>
    <link>/talk/t/about-the-free-goodies-category/7768</link>
    <description>Curated list of cool and **free** stuff we find. Those **may** be last for *a very limited time*!

Why &quot;free goodies&quot;, though? I believe most good things in life **must** be for free, in one way or another. The [current financial system model is broken](/talk/t/my-social-unfair-undervaluation-and-why-the-financial-system-is-broken/7751) and that&#39;s a big reason why [basiux](basiux.org) was made non profit. Truth is I don&#39;t know of a better system and it&#39;s still one of our best technologies ever invented, which people struggle a lot to comprehend as being a tech, but *[it&#39;s still broken nonetheless](/talk/t/why-the-financial-system-is-broken/7769?u=cregox)*. :)

This started as a small mailing I used to send out with [AppShopper](http://appshopper.com/) recommendations on apps I&#39;d follow that were not free and then they were either turned into free or going into a brief promotion period.

Wished there were such an AppShopper watcher service for Android... Mac... Amazon... Well, anything really! :P</description>
