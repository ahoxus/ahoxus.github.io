        <p>Few days ago I decided even this food seeker idea is too much for a next step.</p>

<p>So now I'm thinking about building either <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/17273607/">some kind of simple game</a> (or maybe some kind of <a href="http://cregox.com/esfi">esfi</a>) and/or an introductory video seeking for investment, like <a href="http://googlepleasehire.me/">that guy who did it for google</a>.</p>

<p>You see, I could use a good scholarship and I'm on the latest age I could get one. Instead of going to college with that money it, though, I'd spend it on expenses to focus in one thing only: get my project done (food seekers). 4 years will sure be enough. I could, in fact, get something done in the first year, now I know what it is. I actually have written a very simple script for a simpler idea yet.</p>

<p>I'd go to the best schools I could get free access to, anywhere in the world, and meet with people who are willing to join in and make it happen. I'd go to conventions and centers where I can meet those young people of any age, such as myself. I could do it alone in the first couple years, worst case scenario.</p>

<p>And I would make it happen. Just like I did with other <a href="http://www.cregox.com/projects/">achievable projects</a>.</p>

<p>But, I realize even if I do make a great video I still may find nobody willing to bet on me. Reason why I thought of just making "some simple game" and profiting from it. This, however, is something I might not be able to do within the few short months left I got in front of me...</p>

<p>And there I go, keep on trying to move forward! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink" width="20" height="20"></p>
