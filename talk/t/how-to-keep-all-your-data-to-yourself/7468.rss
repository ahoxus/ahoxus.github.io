**Warning**: very confusing &quot;*personal note*&quot; post here! But since nobody ever signed up this blog (or bothered to show up), whatever. :P

I only wished I knew the answer. While enabling it to be **easy to find**. I spend a whole lot of time trying to answer this over the years, and I still couldn&#39;t.

[Backup](http://talk.cregox.com/t/my-second-online-backup-choice/7411) and [versioning](http://talk.cregox.com/t/time-to-focus-on-versioning/5601) are just two computer technical terms related to &quot;keeping your data&quot;. Computer themselves are quite good and reliable means to do that, because they facilitate making data **redundant**. That&#39;s the keyword here. **Redundant**. That&#39;s also how brain memory works. Or google&#39;s pagerank. The more links, the more redundancy, the stronger any *piece of data* will be recorded in history. And it will have easier access as well, facilitate finding them.

[Computer backup is a huge big topic to me][2]. For a [long time (haven&#39;t used Tonido yet)][3]. I think I got to a point I&#39;m satisfied with making redundancy of what I&#39;ve already got offline: **dropbox**, **crashplan** and **time machine**. I&#39;m still struggling with mobile devices, though I&#39;m not too worried. Usually I take a couple days to recover from losses there (there have been plenty), and I lose basically no important data. iPhone and Android already have good backup systems built-in, even though they&#39;re only cloud based, I&#39;ve already many important parts of that cloud in my desktop backup system there. That brings the difficult part... The cloud.

How to keep our cloud data?

I&#39;m already [backing up my youtube favorites with JDownloader][4]. Also using IFTTT for somethings (such as twitter), Insync for Google Drive, Apple Calendar and Mail, and probably few more other awesome tools I forget...

For the rest of the web, I would simply sign up for [pocket premium][5] and start pocketing up everything I&#39;ve got on the web. Sounds like it could cover it, but that&#39;s not really a good backup solution. I only consider any solution a backup solution if it brings data to my desktop, and only because I&#39;ve already got all redundancy automated creation tools in place here. Pocket for mac does cache everything up, but only in a very &quot;cryptic&quot; format made for the app to read. I guess the jury is still out for this idea...

Google Takeout, for instance, is a terrible &quot;backup&quot; tool, simply because it&#39;s not automated. Else it would be awesome! Although it&#39;d still be lacking the &quot;easy to find data in it&quot; part.

So I still got a freaking lot of my cloud data out of my backup reach. Recently I lost many posts I had on a forum, because the forum folks, like 99% of people including most tech specialists, don&#39;t care enough for data and lost it. Twice.

I&#39;ve got no backup even of my squarespace website, for fucking sake! :(

Anyway, I guess all I can say to end this confusing post for now is:

**Nobody care enough for your data but you**. Keep that in mind.
