    <description>the original idea was to invite my previous group from ETA, back when I was in Sao Paulo.

all you have to do is join in this forums, read up what interests you and start interacting!

I want to make a play out of [basiux&#39;s novel](https://github.com/cauerego/cauerego.github.io/wiki/a-novel). doesn&#39;t mean we will make it, it could be too hard, but if we could do it that would be ***legen***...

&gt; (do read the novel!! https://github.com/cauerego/cauerego.github.io/wiki/a-novel)

... *wait for it* ...

***dary!***

wouldn&#39;t it? :)

anyway, if it doesn&#39;t happen... [don&#39;t worry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-diB65scQU)!

edited: I&#39;ve made this topic after talking with a friend (Amanda) and trying to convince her to participate by telling her a little story about my quest. I&#39;ll now build a new wiki page with that story as a meta making of story of the novel! :smile:
