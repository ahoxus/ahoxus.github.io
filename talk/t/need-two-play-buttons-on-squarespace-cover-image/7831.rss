    <description>[quote=Mike Lanza]

Hello Caue,

For the Squarespace web site for a new iOS app I&#39;m launching, my design has
a cover photo on the home page with two play buttons for videos - one on
the left and one on the right. The video triggered by the play button on
the left can be full screen, letter boxed. The video triggered by the play
button on the right is in the shape of an iPhone in portrait mode - i.e.
vertical orientation.

My reason for having these two play buttons is that I have two videos that
communicate two different, parallel marketing messages about the app, like
Lite Beer from Miller Lite&#39;s old &quot;Tastes Great, Less Filling&quot; ad campaign.
( http://buildingpharmabrands.com/2013/04/26/great-taste-less-filling/ )

Can you help me with this?

Once I solve this problem, I&#39;ll still need to build the rest of that page,
another page, and two forms pages. I&#39;ll probably ask help from someone -
you or someone else.

Thanks in advance.

- Mike Lanza

<p>Cause,</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that the design I described is just for the desktop<br>site. For the mobile site, of course, there can be only one play button at<br>a time, but I would like them to be fairly close together (think "Tastes<br>great" just an inch or two above "Less filling).</p>

              <p>Hey there Mike,</p>

<p>I really don't work with <a href="/talk/t/yeah-im-also-a-progammer/7676">progamming*</a> <strong>freelancing</strong> anymore, basically because <em>nobody</em> wanted to pay my perceived costs (as you can see from my <a href="/talk/t/lazy-loading-for-squarespace-grid-gallery/7810/4">previous ticket</a>).</p>

<p>For your case, without knowing more about your biz, I would setup a single button for each case automatically and add a smaller link on the bottom within the sitemap, containing links to everything someone might want to see.</p>

<p>I can't see what you mean in that Miller's Lite link. And it would help if you added more reference links.</p>

<p>In any case, if <a href="http://www.cregox.com/your-home">you're willing</a> to <a href="http://www.cregox.com/pay"><strong>pay</strong></a> U$123 upfront I can go find someone to do the job for you for much cheaper (I'd start with fiverr crazy people), pay it from my pocket, double check on their first work and let you both continue from there.</p>
