Message: Hi there,


I was wondering if you would be able to give me a quote on a mass drop
style website, with a few social features in addition to a calendar with
options to vote on each item in the time line?


I&#39;m not sure how much information I should be including in this for your,
but if you want to chat about it, feel free to add me on skype (no google
voice as I&#39;m out of the states)


Skype:uhoniakupo


Regards

Devon

              <p>Please, Devon, do read <a href="http://www.cregox.com/your-home">www.cregox.com/your-home</a> in case you haven't. That already answers most of your questions, and maybe a few you didn't have! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>I have no clue on what you mean by "a mass drop style website" so links and screenshots showing references would be required.</p>

<p>Social features is a nice point in squarespace, they're really easy to add.</p>

<p>And calendar with options to vote on each item might be tricky, but it's sure doable. To have a better dimension on how you want this, again, please add links, screenshots or sketches of how you envision this.</p>

<p>After this, we may talk on skype if you want: caue.rego</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
