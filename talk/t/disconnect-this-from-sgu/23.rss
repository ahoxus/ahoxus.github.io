    <title>Disconnect this from SGU?</title>
    <link>/talk/t/disconnect-this-from-sgu/23</link>
    <description>A friend brought in this shiny new idea: *why SGU?*

I don&#39;t know.

Maybe I should indeed make this a completely separated project. After all, nobody from SGU showed any interest in it and so it&#39;s just a fan-made website. Maybe that way it could bring more interest in the project from a wider audience... I&#39;m just not sure I wanted to see it become too big. Not really something to worry right now, huh?

What do you think? ( *Is anyone there?* )</description>

              <p>Whatever. I'm doing it. But just the disconnect, mainly (except for the domain, too much work for now). I still won't make it a new project. (<em>Nobody cares, why should I?</em>)</p>
