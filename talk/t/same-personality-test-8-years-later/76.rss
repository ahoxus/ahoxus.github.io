    <title>Same personality test, 8 years later</title>
    <link>/talk/t/same-personality-test-8-years-later/76</link>
    <description>&lt;span&gt;I have always had fun filling up tests, especially about myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;There is this test, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.personaldna.com/&quot;&gt;Personal DNA&lt;/a&gt; which have been around for quite a long time and, for some odd reason, keeps getting upgraded with functions that don&#39;t work. That ATTAP company responsible for it has no contact info and no way to know what&#39;s happening there... Creating account doesn&#39;t work, to begin with its issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;But it&#39;s still the best personality test I&#39;ve ever seen! It takes about 30 minutes to complete, it&#39;s very extensive and even if you take it twice in a roll you won&#39;t have the exact same results. So it is quite subjective indeed. It also brings some typical personality info that I like to compare to horoscope. It&#39;s just a lot of mumble jumble, such as &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You are well-attuned to your talents, and can deal with most problems that you face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt; T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;he coolest part about it, I think, is the 13 personality traits. It&#39;s represented in a weird colorful map and later &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.personaldna.com/glossary.php&quot;&gt;dissected&lt;/a&gt; point by point. They claim:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Each bar indicates the percentage of test takers who entered a lower value for that trait than you did. For example, if Confidence is at 80, that means that 80% of people entered lower values for confidence questions than you did. Based on a sample of 30,000 users&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;span&gt;If that&#39;s true, and if there is indeed enough people taking the test, that&#39;s wicked cool!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;So...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.personaldna.com/report.php?k=nqTCgQmBqHWpQvZ-OC-ACDCA-c571&quot;&gt;My old&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; personal dna report, from my &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cauecmrego.blogspot.com.br/2006/10/personality-test.html&quot;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, says I&#39;m a &quot;respectful leader&quot; and gives me this weird and colorful map (mouse over to see each color&#39;s description):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;





























&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.personaldna.com/report.php?k=nqTCgQmBqHWpQvZ-OC-ACDCA-c571&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Respectful Leader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.personaldna.com/report.php?k=jHiTHDuIwBYoEgQ-MI-DADBC-7fd1&amp;amp;u=e7bee96b5d89&quot;&gt;My new one&lt;/a&gt; says I&#39;m a &quot;free-wheeling analyst&quot; and gives this other colorful map:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;





























&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.personaldna.com/report.php?k=jHiTHDuIwBYoEgQ-MI-DADBC-7fd1&amp;amp;u=e7bee96b5d89&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Free-Wheeling Analyst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Almost half of my traits changed a lot over those last 8 years. Most didn&#39;t. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I&#39;d assess they are all basically true!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the 6 big changes: seems like I&#39;m extremely &lt;b&gt;less open&lt;/b&gt; to new experiences than I was, this means I&#39;m ready to choose and do stuff; &lt;b&gt;a lot more extroverted&lt;/b&gt; and outgoing, awesome; got much &lt;b&gt;much more&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;empathy&lt;/b&gt; towards others thoughts and emotions, yeah baby; and &lt;b&gt;trust a lot less&lt;/b&gt; in others, so I think now think most people aren&#39;t good at heart (nor bad for that matter), because I actually believe most people are just zombies (more on that to another blog post, maybe). I also believe much less than I already did in &lt;b&gt;agency&lt;/b&gt;, in other words, how much me or anyone can change the future - I indeed now believe we can&#39;t, just like we can&#39;t change the past; and I became much less interested in how things look while much &lt;b&gt;more interested in how things work&lt;/b&gt;, though I always prefered functionality over aesthetic, the previous test showed I cared much closer&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;to &lt;i&gt;50 50&lt;/i&gt;, while now it&#39;s almost &lt;i&gt;0&lt;/i&gt; to looks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the rest of 7 little changes, some of which may be insignificant: a little &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;less confident&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; about expressing my opinions, which I like to translate as less confrontative without necessity; little &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;less &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;masculinity&lt;/b&gt; and little &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;more &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;femininity&lt;/b&gt;, which is good because I was too extreme in both stereotypical traits before; a little &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;more spontaneity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; reaching the awesomeness of being comfortable with having no plans; little &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;less attention to style&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; or fashion, which is quite irrelevant as I never gave any attention to how my own dressing style looks, although I eventually might; little &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;more &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;authoritarianism&lt;/b&gt;, favoring the order and the law a little more, but still not so much; and very little &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;less earthy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;, or more imaginative - I&#39;ve always loved theory and abstraction, but I still prefer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;practice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; way much more. Many people may find this last one weird, as many mighty say I dream too much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What I do find bad about this and all other similar tests is exactly this... From my point of view, I got better in every single one of the 13 aspects. I worked to get better, and I did, and I&#39;m glad to see it reflects in such a test. But, in both tests, they say I&#39;m something awesome. How did I go from &quot;Respectful Leader&quot; to &quot;Free-Wheeling Analyst&quot;? That doesn&#39;t seem to reflect the improvement I&#39;ve made, nor to reflect what I was or what I am. This whole &quot;feel good&quot; horoscope part of it is terrible! I&#39;d like to see &quot;You&#39;re a spoiled kid&quot; result for a change, which can actually teach us in what we can or should improve to engage in social norms and / or to learn how to know ourselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In any case, there. That was my &quot; having fun with a personality test&quot; for today! :-P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
