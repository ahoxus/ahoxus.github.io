<p>This is just a quote to this link for my answer on quora: <a href="http://qr.ae/ROw3G7">http://qr.ae/ROw3G7</a></p>

<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote>
<p>In short: it's already helping. Everyone. When you google for something, there's a huge big data Ai in place to give you the best answers. Try Siri and you'll have a glimpse of what Ai can do, and that's still a very weak Ai.</p>
<p>Do you need more than getting answers to any important question almost instantly? Well, the best games out there use heavy Ai - the biggest e-sport game in DOTA style is also one with the most advanced Ai systems in place. How that helps? It helps easing up our mind from the craziness around. A mindfulness technique.</p>
<p>And, yet, all is using Ai as smart as a bacteria. Kind of.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>I won't get into much details, but you may be very skeptical of the last part in the second paragraph. Or even the third one. As you should. And if you are, do your homework. You'll probably find out I'm not too far off from the reality.</p>
<p>"How can Ai help countries in need" could be a way to reword your question. Then, which country don't need help from a superior intelligence? Why focusing only on "developing" countries? Of course there must be something we can do for everyone and most of "everyone" are in the poor region, but make no mistake - most people are poor because they prefer the simplicity of life. Capitalism isn't a zero-sum game and everyone have a choice in one way or another. There sure is misery out there, but even that is almost like a choice.</p>
<p>Here, this is a very geeky pseudo-code I just wrote about Life:</p>

I just wrote this on <a href="../thank-you-for-the-warning-about-crossover/7829/4ba8f.html?u=cregox">another topic</a>, and here I bring it as a wiki: 



 illusion = 0

async choice:
    result = 0.34 * random * illusion
    delay 8  # seconds
    return result

Life:
    born = 0.33 * random  # either 0 or 1
    happy = random
    dead = random
 
    while not dead:
        illusion = random  # perception
        luck = 0.33 * random * illusion
        happy = (born + luck + choice) &gt; 0.5 # is the glass half full?
        dead = random
