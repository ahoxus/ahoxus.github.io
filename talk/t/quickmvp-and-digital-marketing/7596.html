<p>I was <a href="../insurance-angels-and-entrepreneurship/7593.html">talking with someone</a> and one of his advices were <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/">producthunt</a> - there I found about <a href="http://startupstash.com/">startupstash</a> which led me to <a href="http://quickmvp.com/">quickmvp</a> - then when creating an account I noticed they take coupons and it's costumary I google for coupons before moving forward. And that's my short story on how I found <a href="https://medium.com/@lc3t35/how-to-get-800-unique-visitors-in-3-weeks-with-quickmvp-com-c6e19ed5e1e4">your article</a>, Mr <a href="https://www.sohelpful.me/laurentroger">Laurent</a>.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I wanted to do a quickmvp for <a href="http://cregox.com/advisor">my next project</a>, but while I'm pretty sure there's a market for it I'm now not so sure it's worth doing that right now. As good as such a validation might be, and that looks like an awesome "cheap" way to do it, somehow I feel like it's not a good enough next step. Supposing it goes well, I don't see what I could do after that to move it forward! Do you have any advice for this?</p></li>
<li><p>Also, I do have a kind of <a href="../the-making-of-your-home/7491.html">my own startup already working</a>. And I understand me getting in touch with you asking for help have a cost for you. So, how can we make this work for you? Or even more, how do you make this work for you? I know some people just take the first contact costs built in anything else, and I bet that's how you do it as well. It's how I'm trying to do.</p></li>
<li><p>But my company isn't doing well. And I think I need much marketing advise. I suppose maybe a "digital marketing" service, even. Is this something you can work on? I've consulted a few marketing companies, but none so far in english (as I wouldn't know where to begin) and none so far who could take this job.</p></li>
<li><p>I could pay you any value to begin an assessment if you can give me guarantee of satisfaction. I just need to see results. If I'm paid to make you a website or a tweak, you'll get the website or tweak you want, because I, as the professional here, know better than you what you really need or want. I guarantee you that. Granted, marketing isn't all that straight forward, but you need to tell me what results you can guarantee me, and I'll see if I want to take the risk. If that's worth it to try and get my sales up. So, what's your guarantee?</p></li>
