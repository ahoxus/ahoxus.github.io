    <description>(maybe this will become a short blog post or edited for a better size and meaning)

Who buys an iPhone or Apple product are buying them not because of Apple and not even because of the awesome Steve Wozniak. It&#39;s the other Steve they are looking for. Someone they learned to trust and identify.

Brands are only really valuable when people can humanize them. See them as a friend.

So why don&#39;t we simply do just that? Why nobody associates Mc Donald&#39;s to Ray Kroc, Coca-Cola to John Pemberton or Rolex to Hans Wilsdorf? Will Apple survive through the icon&#39;s death for that long as well?

Maybe that&#39;s precisely why. When the company gets big enough, anyone can create an identity in it, identify the pattern and repeat. Make it immortal, so we won&#39;t miss it when the actual creator dies. Walt Disney and Elvis still live long after death.

In any case... I&#39;d just like to see more humanised smartphone models / brands so I could find someone to follow... For one because Apple did lose theirs, for two because it was never my ideal and for three because when I do find one, I&#39;d like to be able to follow the person, even if they change brands / companies, until they may become an immortal brand, if I get that lucky! :)</description>
