<p>That sounds very reasonable, but doesn't the "a lot of plant food" part of it exist only because nowadays we eat too little plants? If we lived in a society where people would eat mostly plants, wouldn't that be replaced by "a lot of meat"? I mean, as a general rule, that sounds a little confusing to me. And, as a general rule, I find it too hard to find similar data on the webs.</p>
