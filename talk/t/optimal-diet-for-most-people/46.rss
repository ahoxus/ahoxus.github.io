    <title>Optimal diet for most people</title>
    <link>/talk/t/optimal-diet-for-most-people/46</link>
    <description>On [episode #469][1] Steve says that, for the average person, or most people, the optimal diet consists about 90% of this: &quot;**Eat a variety of food, a lot of plant food and not too much.**&quot;

That sounds very reasonable, but doesn&#39;t the &quot;a lot of plant food&quot; part of it exist only because nowadays we eat too little plants? If we lived in a society where people would eat mostly plants, wouldn&#39;t that be replaced by &quot;a lot of meat&quot;? I mean, as a general rule, that sounds a little confusing to me. And, as a general rule, I find it too hard to find similar data on the webs.

<p>That sounds very reasonable, but doesn't the "a lot of plant food" part of it exist only because nowadays we eat too little plants?
