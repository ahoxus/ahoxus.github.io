    <title>About the wiki category</title>
    <link>http://talk.cregox.com/t/about-the-knowledge-category/7759</link>
    <description>cregox knowledge database, the wiki way, constantly changing and improving (until basiux can take over).

- Why should you use this category? What is it for?

Collaborate with cregox school, basically.

- What should topics in this category generally contain?

Summing up whatever is talked on all the other topics, plus what&#39;s not there yet but would help building up our body of knowledge towards educating people about technology, science, critical thinking, arts and communication, among other sub related topics.

- Do we need this category? Can we merge with another category, or subcategory?

This should be a summary of cregox. So, not merging and yes it&#39;s needed! :)</description>
