806 videos which, to me, look like good TV about relevant and interesting News topics around the world: https://www.youtube.com/user/TestTubeNetwork (found it through [random web surfing](https://www.youtube.com/user/ShotsOfAwe/about)).

It&#39;s a shame most of their video seem to be out of youtube (and in their lame website video playing) for whatever reason, probably trying to capitalize more like small business try to profit more using less credit card companies. can&#39;t really [blame them, but I still do it](https://www.facebook.com/caue.rego/posts/10153288437140868:0?pnref=story) and kinda enjoy it. :P after all, it&#39;s not surprisingly fun to criticize things that don&#39;t quite work when you&#39;re not the one trying to make it through.</description>
