Hi,

This is Kirsten from TBWA. Recently, we have used Sqaurespace to build a
website, you can find the preview from here
&lt;http://aids-concern.squarespace.com/&gt;. But for some reasons, we need to
find some specialists help us to build the rest of the pages (Policy, Media
and Support Us) in next three days. So just want to know if you were
possible to help. Since this is quite urgent, great if you can get back to
me at your soonest.

To know more details on the rest of the page, you can refer to the pdf
attached.

Besides, we need to fix some comments on other pages, which will also need
your help to check, please kindly refer to the comment pdf attached.

Looking for your reply.

Thanks
Kirsten

<p>From a quick glance, I also couldn't find any issues on the pages listed there...</p>

<p>That being said, I am available to work and we definitely can talk business even if you need such an urgent due date.</p>

<p>I do need much more details though. Please read <a href="http://www.cregox.com/your-home">www.cregox.com/your-home</a> for more details about me. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink" width="20" height="20"></p>
