    <description>[quote]
I am looking for some custom code, I want to alter a couple of things on my site.

www.outstyled.com

1. My shop page is getting to big to load easily on mobile devices and I need a work around. My ideas are Pagination, either numbered pages or something as simple as ‘older/newer’ buttons. Or making it so only part of the page loads at a time and more will load as you scroll down the page. I want a lot of products in the shop and do not want to slow anyone down when they go to the site.

2. I would like the margins on all of the pages to be the same width. I like that the shop is full screen, but the other pages are not.

Please let me know if you have time to help and what you would charge for each of these fixes.

Thanks!
Cass

              <p>This situation is terrible for me. Horrifying!</p>

<p>I could see the problem (hopefully the same you saw), but I can't really easily reproduce it. I believe it  have something to do with adding products and caching.</p>

<p>What scares me most is I'm in no condition to dedicate time to this anymore. I'm not sure you are aware, but <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/the-making-of-your-home/7491/6?u=cawas">I'm no longer in this business</a>. Still, by coincidence I saw your message as soon as it arrived. And I hardly ever leave a direct message to me hanging for more than 1 day anyway. I just didn't know what to say in this case...</p>

<p>Right now I can say (and couldn't in the first day) I only got to see the problem because I've been trying, little by little, to see what I can do in these past days. And I'll keep trying whenever I'm able to squeeze some time in.</p>

<p>This is a surprising hairy problem, even for coming up with a quick fix. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/frowning.png?v=0" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt="frowning" width="20" height="20"></p>

              <p>Hi<br>We are having the same problem with the shop as before. I wanted to ask again if you are able to fix it. When I click on the shop I do not see all of the product, there are always items missing until I refresh the page. It seems like the newest product is always there, then several are missing. Can you fix this? We add one new product everyday.</p>

              <p>Continuing from the last video, I'll basically just copy the steps needed here, with mostly updated code and a few other updates, for better visualization.</p>

<p><small>First some technical self reference: I took this as a personal project to evolve my business there, as I said before. So most of the code is now on its own CDN ( by using rawgit as <a href="https://github.com/cregox/endless-scrolling/blob/master/endless-scrolling.html#L1">exposed in the first line</a> ) and <a href="https://github.com/cregox/endless-scrolling/commits/master">on a new repository</a>. Just compiling this post alone, despite being mostly copied from previous ones, took me about 1 hour. Then little less than 1 extra hour to tweak scripts a bit more, polish it, and finally another one for the video production! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/open_mouth.png?v=0" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt="open_mouth" width="64" height="64"><br></small></p>

<p>Instead of renaming the old shop, I've left it with the same name and created a new page called <code>shop-list</code> (instead of using the <code>new-shop</code>, which I left there).</p>

<h2>Keep in mind</h2>

<p>The scripts have a few lines that rely on both <code>/shop</code> and <code>/shop-list</code> page names, the <strong>URL Slug</strong> as it's called under page settings. If you rename any of the two pages, please remember to rename it there in the code too. Fortunately that shouldn't happen that often!</p>

<p>There are a few things needed to <a href="https://github.com/cauerego/cregox-scripts/tree/master/squarespace/endless%20scrolling">recreate it from scratch</a>, in case you do need to do it:</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<p><strong>1)</strong> A page with a <strong>grid summary block</strong> inside and displaying <strong>thumbnail</strong> and <strong>price</strong> only (haven't even tested with other options). Column width here won't matter and there is no more paging abstraction, so <strong>number of items</strong> also won't matter (better just leave it at 1).</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> That page need to have an <strong>animated GIF</strong> with the loading image animation, and a <strong>clickthrough URL</strong> link set to <code>javascript:endlessScrollingLoading();</code></p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> Still on the same page, copy and paste the file <a href="https://github.com/cregox/endless-scrolling/blob/a4670ec0d0f5d8a78ad2d2f0c1634320b9158a45/endless-scrolling.html"><code>endless-scrolling.html</code></a> to that page's <strong>advanced settings</strong>, under <strong>page header code injection</strong></p>

<p><strong>4)</strong> Apply <a href="https://github.com/cregox/endless-scrolling/blob/a4670ec0d0f5d8a78ad2d2f0c1634320b9158a45/endless-scrolling-print.html"><code>endless-scrolling-print.html</code></a> on the shop page to fix the product item <code>&lt; SHOP</code> "back" button. I've uncommented the line from before so there will be no "print" function this time. Also replaced <code>new-shop</code> by <code>shop-list</code> as advised under "keep in mind" up there:</p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;!--meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=/shop-list"--&gt;
&lt;script name="endless scrolling" author="cregox.com"&gt;
  // main settings 
  // change this to the correspondent URL Slug
  var shopList = '/shop-list';
  
  //////////////////
  
  var thisPage = Static.SQUARESPACE_CONTEXT.collection.fullUrl;
  if (location.pathname === thisPage)
  {
    location.replace(shopList);
  }
  Y.use('node', function()
  {
    Y.on('domready', function()
    {
      var pageId = window.location.href.split('/').pop();
      Y.all('a[href$="'+ thisPage +'"]').set('href', shopList + '/#p@' + pageId);
    });
  });
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p><strong>5)</strong> Copy and paste the <a href="https://github.com/cregox/endless-scrolling/blob/a4670ec0d0f5d8a78ad2d2f0c1634320b9158a45/endless-scrolling.less"><code>endless-scrolling.less</code></a> file into Custom CSS, tweak it at your will, and have fun! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/yum.png?v=0" title=":yum:" class="emoji" alt="yum" width="64" height="64"> </p>

              <p>I think we are all set except for the new video. It's fine if you make the new-shop live while you make the video. Just so I understand, our new-shop is a summary of the old shop...is that correct? You mentioned that we can't delete it and I'm not sure I understand why.</p>

              <p>So, I've reached my limit here. At least for now.</p>

<p>I won't be able to develop this any further and I really hope it's satisfactory <a href="https://github.com/cauerego/cregox-scripts/commits/master/squarespace/endless%20scrolling">the way it is now</a>.</p>

<p>The image blurring is basically fixed by using a bigger default size. Before it was 300px, now it is 750px. Squarespace shop dynamically sets it, and it can go up to 1500px, but even for big screens nowadays 750 is enough. Also, I'm using <code>srcset</code> which will allow for the browser to properly choose a size. This works fine with chrome already, but not many others.</p>

<p>I'm not sure when and if I'll be able to go back into building more on this. There are still somethings that could be improved.</p>

<p>So please, just answer me the last question about the video and what else you may be missing and I'll do my best to wrap this up.</p>

<p>I'm very proud of the results here so far and the way it is today. Really hope you've enjoyed it. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink" width="20" height="20"></p>

              <p>Cool! Coincidentally I could access the site on a much bigger screen just now and realised what I should have known before, about that new "blurriness" issue there. Probably the big reason why the original squarespace shop crash on mobile is precisely that high quality image multiplied by 100. I'll fix that later on.</p>

<p>Will that be all?! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile" width="64" height="64"></p>

<p>Switching is just a matter of renaming the pages. <code>shop</code> should become <code>shop-print</code> or anything else (can't delete it). If there's no link to it, only way to access would be direct link, which is fine. Whatever the new name is have to be also set on the script. And <code>new-shop</code> becomes <code>shop</code>. I can show that on the new video and then quickly revert back, but then it will become live for that little while if that's fine for you.</p>

<p>If steals are all items duplicated from shop, you could make it very much like the new-shop simply by using a summary filter such as category. You could also just make a new products page and make it separated.</p>

<p>If you want to apply it to archives, it will all be the same thing. Have a products page, make a regular page with a summary block and code injected to its advanced settings.</p>

              <p>Everything is looking really good. The margin thing seems to be fixed. The only thing I noticed was on my iphone the first image was clear and the rest of them were blurry...but not as blurry as before. Once everything is fixed, how do we switch the new-shop to be the main shop?</p>

<p>I would also like to understand how to make the Steals page into a shop like the new-shop. Perhaps I can do it on my own with your new video : )</p>

<p>Will we have to do anything special with the Archives? The older seasons are set up as our regular Shop currently.</p>

              <p>A screenshot would be helpful, as I'm not sure what you mean.</p>

<p>In any case, I did see something that might be related and I've added this code on CSS to fix it:</p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">@media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {
  body main#main {
    width: 100% !important;
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>Was this it? If it was, this have been an issue for quite a while.</p>

<p>As for the new blur, I was testing with trying to speed things on mobile, but it ended up "blurring" all loaded images (not related to the previous blurring behaviour, which would then load a higher quality when on screen). Also already easily fixed.</p>

<p>And sure, I can record a new video when you think it's in a final satisfying result. I understand I was a bit confusing at some parts, I haven't even watched it again, I'll probably be able to see it when I do.</p>

<p>In any case, please see it again now! I just realized it actually is quite faster without loading the low quality images first.</p>

<p>In terms of the video, I thought there were a couple of spots where you were showing how to do something and then after you did it you would change your mind and do it another way. It was a bit hard to follow.</p>

<p>Nothing from the video will change, except it will be different code to apply. What you found confusing in specific? I actually thought it was too long, so maybe you want me to get into more details but less technical. Is that it?</p>

<p>We are happy to stay with Supply and work thru the bugs. Would you mind making a another video with instructions once your work is complete? The one you made already is a bit confusing and I am not sure if anything has changed with your recent work.</p>

              <p>On a better thought, how about this: I'll just give up on making this a job (saying this because I'm not sure you've read my edit there). I could eventually take a project like this and turn it into my own featured open source project. From the past 6 months, I can't remember a single job that required to build something to <strong>fix a completely broken behaviour</strong> on squarespace.</p>

<p>I guess that's why I was already so dragged into this to begin with anyway! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>What matters most to you from my decision there is I'll try to focus more on it and probably end up much earlier than if I kept my previous mindset.</p>

<p>So...</p>

<p>I've fixed (actually hide) the loading sequence (which was one bug I had seen, just not on my chrome), and I can remove the "blurred" images (actually low resolution ones) if you insist. But keep in mind Google just release a <a>new photos</a> on Google I/O just yesterday and coincidentally that blurring is one nice feature it has!</p>

<p>You see, loading quality images take resources. Loading smaller ones takes much much less, makes things faster. Instead of the low-res img I could put nothing or leave the product price there, but neither will look as cool as this. At least technically speaking. I'm not so much expert in designing arts and layout, but I can understand why you might not like this. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Thanks to the lazy loading, I fairly easily implemented the paging number I've mentioned in the video and many times since the beginning. Then added that into the shop item page, so even the <code>&lt; BACK</code> button will go back to the proper scrolled place (once we implement it there).</p>

<p>Right now, I'm only missing reloading and 1 bug I can see only on mobile, which keeps scrolling back to top. I'm also still not satisfied with loading speed on my android, which maybe improved by removing the small res images after all. Only reason I haven't tried it yet is, as so many things here, it's not that simple. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue" width="20" height="20"></p>
