    <description>&lt;img src=&#39;/uploads/default/113/49b9455cd00720d4.jpg&#39;&gt;

Here&#39;s a bit about my projects and plans for 2015:

I&#39;ve got basically 1 main project for this year ([in contrast with 2014][1], this is much more achievable), basically suggested by my brother ([again][2]). For now I&#39;m calling it just [Advisor][3]. I really like his practical ideas. But there&#39;s not much to say about that. I still don&#39;t know what to make for it other than [building a mvp][4], and so I&#39;ve got it frozen.

So far this year I started looking for jobs but, at same time, I ended up investing on [my little startup][5]. So, those are what are taking most of my time, so far.

Anyway, back to the topic, I also got a side project. I still want to make [a kind of game (food seekers)][6]. And I&#39;ve been reducing it to [less][7] and now even less. Hopefully it will soon get to a point it&#39;s small enough that I can actually build it!

This would be a mix up of both previous ideas, along with tetris and mahjong. It&#39;s quite simple...

Pattern recognition is the key. If you don&#39;t do anything, it will slowly do it by itself, so you can act as a catalyzer.

The visual is all abstract, probably in 3D, and there has to be some good music and sounds (this is where [my good friend][8] might join).

As you go forward on the game you&#39;d see you&#39;re actually building a DNA of something. That would be a beautiful graphics part, but then you can&#39;t really interact much anymore, I suppose.

What you think? Should I also try to make a quickmvp for this? :P

<p>The music here needs to be pop and pleasing. Classic. So that work is <strong>very</strong> interesting! I can see even that working, if it just had a much higher quality MIDI sampler.</p>

<p>In fact, I think it would <strong>probably</strong> be so much better if it had no music and just a few good sampling noises rather than just a "film" background soundtrack seemly disconnected from the game movements.</p>

<p>But, in all cases, I still think lastly it will be your call.</p>

              <p>Sorry, I didn't get a message on my email so didn't even notice you've already post it. Here is Tristan Perich. It's an interesting work, but now I don't think is so related to what we are talking about. I would love to be able to code the music, but being realistic, if you need music for your game, it would be easier to just send you samples, as I would do for a film soundtrack. </p>

              <p>I don't really have a plan (yet), but I picture I will be doing it in blocks. And the first block has to be somehow playable already, with no story and maybe not even patterns. Just a proof of concept that it can be done.</p>

<p>Music in games are basically <strong>always</strong> samples. There is at least one recent game that's different, and if you play it you'll noticed how different it is: <a href="http://blekgame.com/">blek</a>. That's such an inspiration for this... Of course it would be much better if it's synthesized by algorithms, but then I wouldn't know how! I mean, to make it so it yields to a pleasing sound as result.</p>

<p>But I suppose first thing we need is a name. It doesn't need to be final, it just need to be a at least a project name. How about <strong>Dhat</strong>? It's a mix up of dna, mahjong and tetris to make it sound like <em>that</em>. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue" width="20" height="20"></p>
