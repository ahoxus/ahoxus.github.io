Hi Caue

Many thanks for your answer on this Squarespace article:

http://answers.squarespace.com/questions/4182/how-can-i-lightbox-an-embedded-video-full-screen-without-coding?page=1#70180

As you have suggested I have created a separate question here:

http://answers.squarespace.com/questions/75453/how-to-create-a-video-play-button-like-on-introducing-squarespace-seven

It would be great if you could help us create a video button like on
&quot;Introducing Squarepsace Seven&quot; for our page at www.generation-y.ch. Your
efforts can also be handled within a paid assignment.

It would be much appreciated it you could contact me at
werner@generation-y.ch

Many thanks,
Werner

              <p>I'm just <strong>guessing</strong> here, but looks like you may have selected the <a href="http://help.squarespace.com/guides/using-the-image-block#toc-set-the-image-to-open-in-a-lightbox--optional-">Lightbox feature on the Image Block</a>. If you want any <a href="http://help.squarespace.com/guides/using-the-image-block#toc-link-the-image--optional-">image block click through link</a> to work, you have to leave that on the default unchecked.</p>

<p>There's another caveat there, for your test page. Since the video gallery solution uses the exact same video, the <code>jqueryLightbox</code> will hide it once it works. And since it's not working, that's where its secret lies... You need to add a gallery anywhere in the page, exactly like that one you just did, for the <code>jqueryLightbox</code> link to use it (and hide it). Maybe you already knew that, this is just a test page after all. But it will look a bit broken when it works. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile" width="20" height="20"></p>

              <p>Thanks so much. Your solution does look impressive. It'll be really cool to be able to use images, textlinks and buttons to play a video full screen.</p>

<p>But I guess I didn't get so far how to implement it. Have created a <a href="https://www.generation-y.ch/fullvideo" rel="nofollow">test page</a> here where I am trying to play this video on vimeo <a href="https://vimeo.com/115116679" rel="nofollow">https://vimeo.com/115116679</a></p>

<p>The script has been pasted into settings/advanced/page header code injection. But I am not able to use it with the play button. </p>

<p>Could you please help?</p>

              <p>Yeah. I'll work on removing the thumbnail, but since it's not the same as the button you could hack it away using a black image... Or maybe, it just happened to me, simply removing the thumbnail might work.</p>

<p>The vimeo controls are no problem as we use a pro account and can tweak the controls quite a bit.</p>

<p>Removing thumbnail would be a nice to have. As long as it is not the play button image it shouldn't be as much of a problem as we can define the video thumbnail image in vimeo pro.</p>

<p>Does this help?</p>

<p>Now I just moved the button to the side and added a text to make it more clear it was already as responsive as squarespace already is.</p>

<p>But I still wonder about the two points I brought in before, removing vimeo controls and the thumbnail when loading (which is not the play button thumbnail).</p>

<p>In any case, I guess I got what you want now.</p>

<p>Take a look if this is it (just made it):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cregox.com/full-video/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.cregox.com/full-video/</a></p>

<p>I probably still could improve it in a few ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>By removing the vimeo controls (easier with a pro account which I don't have), because making this the same way SS7 video work ended up screwing up a bit with vimeo controls, which I couldn't touch enough to keep it there.</p></li>
<li><p>Or maybe there's a code-hackish way to remove the thumbnail when loading - other than, you know, using a custom dark image hack, which you'd probably think about. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue" width="20" height="20"></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I hope that's at least pretty close from all you need.</p>

<p>Now, I'm gonna try and see if I can find that PDF...</p>

<li>You can just give you the code needed and I will apply it myself.</li>
<li>I guess we currently don’t have the same understanding of the requirements. Or perhaps I have understood you wrong. There is no need to play a video in the background. It’s just the implementation of a «video play button» in order to be able to play embedded videos fullscreen.</li>

<p>I've modified my <strong>Terms of Work</strong> slightly, and now I require every new customer to understand how the business will work before I begin. This is what's new and relevant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the payment I'll analyze the project deeper and properly. For most new projects (which are most of the requests I get) I have no way to analyze without actually doing part of it, or all of it. I may require more hours to get everything you need done. We can then agree on me doing less, you paying more, or we getting you a full refund. For any project that's just implementing code that already exists, such as the ones I've made myself (do check my github), it might cost you less than U$321 down to a low of U$123...</p>
<p>It might cost you nothing as well, you can just grab the code from there and implement it yourself! I offer them for free! If I get enough requests, eventually I may even start doing tutorials on how to implement a few things. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink" width="20" height="20"></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're okay, I'll begin working today.</p>

<p>And since I expect this to be no issue to you, already got you two questions:</p>

<p>First, do you prefer me to work <em>straight on your squarespace</em> or should I just <em>give you the code</em> needed and <em>you apply it yourself</em>? If it's the first, I'll need <a href="http://help.squarespace.com/guides/managing-contributor-permissions">admin access</a>.</p>

<p>Then, I can easily picture how to do this for the <a href="http://www.generation-y.ch/#welcome">first section</a>, with only 1 button and good height size. The current video would play on its background, dimmed out by some white overlapping transparency.</p>

<p>But the <a href="http://www.generation-y.ch/#digital-first">second section</a> gets too big and the video wouldn't fit well. So we either need to crop it, repeat it or stretch it. I'd probably go for cropping, how about you?</p>

<p>I'm also not sure what you expect to see under <a href="http://www.generation-y.ch/#brandpower">brandpower</a>, which have 2 buttons side by side. Do you want both bg videos simultaneously, splitted in half screen? I would prefer choosing one to show on the background, even if it's a 3rd one which would mix up both.</p>

<p>And I'm glad to be working with you on this! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile" width="20" height="20"></p>

              <p>Thanks for sending the invoice. I have paid it this morning. </p>

<p>The goal would be to replace the orange video buttons on <a href="http://www.generation-y.ch" rel="nofollow">www.generation-y.ch</a> with a solution like on "Introducing Squarespace Seven" (http://www.squarespace.com/seven) which plays the videos in full screen. The videos would be hosted on Vimeo Pro.</p>

<p>Lokking forward to working with you.</p>

              <p>Thanks for getting in touch, Werner!</p>

<p>Yeah, I've seen your page on the first time, when I said it was a great hack you've done there. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Well, like I just commented with you there (again), what I would try to do is mix up many hacks into my likening. I have no doubt it's possible to do it in squarespace, with relatively little code and effort. And if I see enough people interested in this eventually I could even build a tutorial like the other specialists like to do... But not for now. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Here's the steps I'd go to make it, using these as references:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://answers.squarespace.com/questions/61236/how-can-i-put-a-full-screen-video-as-background/77033">Muno's solution</a> sure <a href="http://www.muno.space/code-snippets/video-backgrounds">looks great</a>, but I'm not sure it's better to host videos on squarespace. I doubt there's any place better than youtube (unless you're doing porn, and I mean it). In any case, there's something to learn from there.</li>
<li>A nice hack to play video when pressing a button from the <a href="http://answers.squarespace.com/questions/34332/video-lightbox-link-using-bedford">link</a> I gave you there, and <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/using-a-gallery-instead-of-the-template-banner/7476/19">from my other work</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And if you're willing to pay for me doing it, please do read <a href="http://www.cregox.com/your-home">www.cregox.com/your-home</a> first. I can do this for U$321, paid upfront, usually within 1 week from payment. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/heavy_dollar_sign.png?v=0" title=":heavy_dollar_sign:" class="emoji" alt="heavy_dollar_sign" width="20" height="20"> </p>

<p>Hi Caue</p>
<p>Many thanks for your answer on this Squarespace article:</p>

<p>As you have suggested I have created a separate question here:</p>

<p>It would be great if you could help us create a video button like on<br>"Introducing Squarepsace Seven" for our page at <a href="http://www.generation-y.ch">www.generation-y.ch</a>. Your<br>efforts can also be handled within a paid assignment.</p>
<p>It would be much appreciated it you could contact me at<br>werner@generation-y.ch</p>
