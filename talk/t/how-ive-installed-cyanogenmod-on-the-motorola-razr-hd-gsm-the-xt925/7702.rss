### Disclaimers

- First of all: if you want to use clockwork or have the latest android releases, do yourself a favor and get a Nexus phone. Or, maybe, a OnePlus. In worst case scenario, go for freaking Samsung. Don&#39;t think Motorola, LG or anything else will make things easier. It won&#39;t.

- Well, I just spent a whole freaking day stuck in a few points which could have been made much simpler if there was a few points better explained in a lot of good other tutorials I&#39;ve found along the way.

- [Here&#39;s the same guide][1] in XDA.

# A &quot;bad guide&quot;, with no revisions

The main reference to me was, as one might expect, [URL=&quot;https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_xt925&quot;]from cyanogen mod wiki[/URL].

The real steps needed are very similar:

1. Unlock device
2. Install recovery using fastboot
3. Wipe every single thing
4. Install CyanogenMod from recovery

All steps but 3 can be found on that wiki. Step 3 can actually become really big. Making it as clean as possible could be very complicated. Or [URL=&quot;http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=63028848&amp;postcount=7&quot;]very simple[/URL].

The most important thing is understanding the concepts of what&#39;s being done and knowing how long each step can actually take. Specially the ones that give no feedback. Such as that [URL=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MotoG/comments/34b9dc/help_flashing_cm_121_error/&quot;]terrible horrible loading screen[/URL], which I&#39;ve learned to hate. [B]The &quot;spinning CM robot&quot; should appear for 1 or 2 minutes at most[/B], but that&#39;s way too far from clear and that info is nowhere to be found.

I won&#39;t repeat the tutorial, rather I&#39;ll explain it and correct it.

## Unlocking Device

This is for allowing your Razr to be tweaked. And it&#39;s not rooting the device as it may appear (being somewhat a newbie and not too interested in rooting, I&#39;ve mixed up the concepts).

Other than this, the steps on the wiki are pretty clear and complete here, I don&#39;t see how anything could go wrong if you just follow it.

I&#39;ve got no screen that would be more than a few seconds without a feedback.

## Recovery and fastboot

This starts to present apparently minor issues.

It says to use Clockwork Mod but all newest files to download on the other wiki page itself already bring a Recovery Image. Now, CWM is well established and used, but the versions linked there didn&#39;t work on my device. Only the new Cyanogen Recovery works. And it&#39;s not as complete as, although I really appreciate the higher simplicity there. Anyway, in the end CWM is just not needed, a version I could find that loads can&#39;t install any ZIP and it ends up just holding back because it offers a lot of useless options.

And &quot;Volume Down + Power&quot; doesn&#39;t work to boot into recovery. At all. You need to hold Volume Up + Power, or some sort of combination from Vol Up &amp; Down &amp; Power. It&#39;s easier to just look for videos of how it&#39;s done. I can do it quickly most of the times using Vol Down &amp; holding Power to boot into fastboot, and then just hold Vol Down and  quickly hold power for 1 second, release, and keep holding Vol Up until a menu opens up in which you can choose to boot to Recovery (or back to Fastmode as well).

Those misleading things there held me back 1 hour at first... But the CWM really screwed me up big, wasting time trying to use it to fix stuff. It&#39;s just not enough. [B]I guess[/B].

Maybe, however, there&#39;s one thing it could prove to be important. Backing up. Install it for this, if you&#39;re worried about trying to recover data without using google&#39;s own backups, after android is installed. To me, that was more than enough.

I&#39;ve got no screen that would be more than a half a minute without a feedback.

## Wipe every single thing

`fastboot -w`. That&#39;s all that took me, although it did give errors and I still saw many warnings through the whole process, if only I knew this command before, it would have saved me 20 hours or so.

Maybe it was the sum of cleaning up stuff with CWM, but I doubt it.

I really don&#39;t want to get into more details here, right now.

I&#39;ve got no screen that would be more than a few seconds without a feedback for anything I&#39;ve done in this step.

## Recovery for CM

You probably also want to install google apps. Just take the [URL=&quot;http://opengapps.org/?api=5.1&amp;variant=nano&quot;]nano OpenGApps[/URL]. And if you&#39;re trying to use CM stable and it bricks, just get the nightly build.

If you&#39;re lucky, installing with sideload should be enough. All those options are just means to getting the zip files into the device for recovery installation and if you&#39;d only have to use sideload once it&#39;s perfect. Having to use it again eventually is a pain, because it doesn&#39;t save local copies on the device.

Another 2 options: You could also have a SD card to USB adapter, or use CWM mounting SD card and transfer everything through the USB cable.

The biggest missing information in this step, however, is this: the loading CM robot screen, which appears after you boot, when that wiki guide is over and it thinks &quot;everything is fine&quot;. It should be not more than 2 minutes, from my experience.

But google says otherwise. You might be led to believe it could take many minutes, maybe as much as 10. Which can easily be extrapolated by &quot;well, maybe it takes 15&quot;. Before you know it, you&#39;re easily wasting hours waiting for it.

So, there you go. Hope this might have been of any help to you! ;P
