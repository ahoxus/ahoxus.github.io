Hello,

I found you through squarespace specialists.  I just made a new site for my
company and am not as web savvy as I&#39;d like and need css coding or coding
in general and there are a few things I would like to have done and wanted
to get a quote.

Here is my website: www.helloairbot.com

I am using the template horizon and I am hosting my videos through wistia.
I need code done to get my cover video to auto play upon page load.  It&#39;s
currently in a gallery and you have to press the play button.   It will
auto play with a code block but I need code for the block to stretch like
the video currently looks in the gallery.    My old site I was using the
shift template for the parallaxing pages but I wanted the one page scroller
so horizon seemed to be the perfect fit.

So what I need is custom code to make my cover video auto play in the code
block size I need.  I would like to get a couple of my pages to parallax
and I want some drop shadow on some of my pictures/pages as well.  I would
also like to get the hover overlays with the titles of my videos like the
site below as well.
-----------&gt;www.motionstate.com is a site that has the parallaxing and drop
shadow, and graphic hover elements I want.

If you could give me a quote on how much you would charge to make these
changes to my site happen I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks so much!

              <p>Cool, that reminds me of <a href="https://www.lily.camera/">Lily</a>. Gadgets I'd like to play with, but have no real use for (yet)! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Please, if you haven't, do read <a href="http://www.cregox.com/your-home">www.cregox.com/your-home</a> (there's also a link for a few codes on the botton, including background videos).</p>

<p>Adding an auto play to the video <strong>could be</strong> something as simple as adding this code:</p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">$('div.video-fill img').click()</code></pre>

<p>But, with this, I would remove the video sound, at least by default. It's just about setting it in wistia. Makes for better UX.</p>

<p>All the rest is quite more complicated and I would have to dig deeper. Looks like you want many customizations and so it might worth considering going with the <a href="http://developers.squarespace.com/">developer platform</a>.</p>

<p>In any case, I can work on all of it starting with U$321.</p>
