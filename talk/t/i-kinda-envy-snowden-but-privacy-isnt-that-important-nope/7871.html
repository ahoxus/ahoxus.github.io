It is true we have no liberty to be whatever we want to be if we know we&amp;#39;re being watched because we do act differently under new realizations of the present.

<p>It is true we have no liberty to be whatever we want to be if we know we're being watched because we do act differently under new realizations of the present.</p>

<p>But the same could be said in a world where there was no privacy ever and suddenly we'd know we're not being watched. Can you imagine it? It's not that hard to imagine. Take someone who believed there's a God watching and suddenly that person became atheist. Nobody is watching. We will act differently... But was the liberty taken away or given?</p>

<p>There's no relationship that can be proved between privacy / lack of it with liberty. It's all a subjective construction in our minds. And it is constructed in a lot of people minds, I'd bet that probably in most of us, including myself as a product of my own culture, even on times I'd like to deny it.</p>

<p>The right to liberty isn't the same as right to privacy, those are terrible grounds to be in. That's not to say we shouldn't have both rights - after all if you have the liberty to choose you should be able to choose privacy for you. But I argue the first, and maybe only right that should be enforced is precisely that freedom of choice. And if you choose no privacy for you, that's up to you.</p>

<p>Or is it? Maybe there's a fallacy here...</p>
