    <description>This is a very early draft!

It is true we have no liberty to be whatever we want to be if we know we&#39;re being watched because we do act differently under new realizations of the present.

But the same could be said in a world where there was no privacy ever and suddenly we&#39;d know we&#39;re not being watched. Can you imagine it? It&#39;s not that hard to imagine. Take someone who believed there&#39;s a God watching and suddenly that person became atheist. Nobody is watching. We will act differently... But was the liberty taken away or given?

There&#39;s no relationship that can be proved between privacy / lack of it with liberty. It&#39;s all a subjective construction in our minds. And it is constructed in a lot of people minds, I&#39;d bet that probably in most of us, including myself as a product of my own culture, even on times I&#39;d like to deny it.

The right to liberty isn&#39;t the same as right to privacy, those are terrible grounds to be in. That&#39;s not to say we shouldn&#39;t have both rights - after all if you have the liberty to choose you should be able to choose privacy for you. But I argue the first, and maybe only right that should be enforced is precisely that freedom of choice. And if you choose no privacy for you, that&#39;s up to you.

Or is it? Maybe there&#39;s a fallacy here...</description>
