Hello SquareSpace Maven,

I&#39;m trying to build a website on SquareSpace platform for my commodities
venture - www.goldbrex.com but not the best designer out there.

I need you to completely make the website amazing using best techniques of
UIX and graphic design techniques to have it up and running. Most
importantly. I need this live gold price plugin there -
http://www.goldcorp.com/English/Home/default.aspx (top right hand corner)
also an interactive page with gold price from its inception to now graph
showcasing it (https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-price-chart.do)

Please let me know if you are able to do this and provide me with a quote.

Thanks!

              <p>Well, after much consideration I must say this will be a big task.</p>

<p>And there's a lot we would need to settle down and discuss before we can reach a final result. Every single aspect of what you asked requires a lot of deliberation.</p>

<p>We're looking here for something that would cost at least U$ 2000 from my point of view right now. To give yet another perspective, an optimistic one, I suppose it won't surpass U$ 4.5 k, but it will all depend on many details.</p>

<p>My suggestion is starting with 1 day of work, which would be U$ 345 (half paid upfront) and we can move from there. We would spend a few hours organizing the whole project on skype or hangout and what could be delivered in the end of the day.</p>

<p>Your case is very distinct from what I usually get, by all measures.</p>

<p>I'll check with a partner if he can take this and I'll let you know soon
