Hi!

I found your tutorial http://www.cregox.com/full-video/ and I&#39;ve been
trying to figure out how to DIY the codes into my squarespace site.

I&#39;ve been doing my best in following your instructions but I still couldn&#39;t
get it to work. It would be extremely helpful if you could point me in the
right direction and tell me what I&#39;m doing wrong.

Here&#39;s a screenshot of my page so far. I&#39;m using a sample video from Vimeo
as the video I want to use is not done yet.

​

I&#39;m trying to place a button on the homepage that plays a full screen video
in a lightbox. As you can see, I&#39;ve already done the following:

1. Added a gallery block (set to Grid and open in lightbox)
2. Added a button above the gallery block (Add the jquery code into it)
3. Added a code block below the video and pasted the long code that you
provided

I can&#39;t figure out what I&#39;m doing wrong and I hope you can help me out.

Your help would be greatly appreciated!

Yours sincerely,

Zulhilmy

              <p>Hi There! </p>

<p>I'm experiencing the same issues here - <a href="http://www.distancefornow.com/watch-the-pilot-2-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.distancefornow.com/watch-the-pilot-2-1</a> (pw: 3000miles). </p>

<p>The youtube video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daZmCFVTmi0" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daZmCFVTmi0</a></p>

<p>and the code I've added to the image block is below.</p>

<p>javascript:jqueryLightbox('daZmCFVTmi0');</p>

<p>Can you point me in the direction of what I'm perhaps doing wrong?</p>

<p>Thanks a ton for your help!</p>

              <p>Thanks for reaching out and pointing me a possible error on my tutorial there, among other few things I should probably fix.</p>

<p>You see, I'm no longer working with my now dead "<a href="/talk/t/the-making-of-your-home/7491">your-home</a>" project (although <a href="/talk/t/dont-know-why-i-cant-stop-applying-for-jobs/7661">I am currently looking for a job</a>), and these tutorials were part of it.</p>

<p>There's also only so much I can do without at least a link to the website.</p>

<p>That being said...</p>

<blockquote><p>jQuery not loaded</p></blockquote>

<p>This means the script couldn't find your link. Probably you didn't use your own video id there:</p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">javascript:jqueryLightbox('&lt;your video id comes here&gt;');</code></pre>

<p>Everything in red there, within the quotes, should be replaced by your own unique video id. And that will be different if you're using youtube, vimeo, wistia or whatever.</p>

<p>I've just updated a couple pages accordingly, with a few things fixed.</p>

<p>Good luck! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink" width="20" height="20"></p>
