<p>It's as if Elon Musk was aware of us... But <a href="http://www.openai.com/">www.openai.com</a> probably wasn't. And still really isn't.</p>

<p>6 days ago <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/675431513211600896">he announced</a> the group formation. I tried joining them as soon as possible, but they're a team of "just" 9 folks looking only for <a href="https://twitter.com/cauerego/status/677200028981702656">exceptionally experienced engineers / ai researchers</a> and I was already not selected.</p>

<p>Open ai is, indeed, the first group I found that's doing <strong>Ai research</strong> the way <a>we in basiux</a> believe it <strong>should be done</strong>, for the longest time: <strong>open sourced and non profit</strong>. Except, they still don't have a nice forum, for whatever reason, and so they're not really going all open just yet.</p>

<p>I guess I'll be doing quite some ranting after all...</p>

<p>But I am in fact thrilled that they now exist! First and foremost, Elon is the best guy to lead this path today. And it's awesome to realize I was <strong>so</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/cauerego/status/674026934746152960">aligned with his thoughts after all</a>.</p>

<p>After that announcement (and even before), a lot of things already happened, other than media obvious and expected explosion around it. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/facebooks-open-sourcing-of-ai-hardware-is-the-start-of-the-deep-learning-revolution/">Facebook also opened their Ai research</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/11/google-open-sources-its-artificial-intelligence-engine/">Google had done so some weeks before</a>. Big Ai is becoming real really fast.</p>

<p>Only problem, in my humble opinion, is people are still clueless of what Ai even is.</p>

<p>I'm still to see a project as good as Tamagotchi X to be made, which can bring such knowledge to people... If things keep going this fast, maybe before the end of the year some of the big guys will also make a much more polished version of it, like openai was to basiux! <img src="http://talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/blush.png?v=0" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"> </p>

<p>I'll have to re-invent myself once again, and I'll officially have lost that train. Probably.  And to think it all may have happened just because I didn't vote 3 times on myself, back on the startup pirates first day, idea selection... I like to think it was all to a good reason.</p>

<p>In any case, it is very cool to see so up close how things are happening, and I'm glad to be alive in such an age in human evolution! <img src="http://talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
