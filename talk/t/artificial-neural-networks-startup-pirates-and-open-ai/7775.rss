*a biological network that resembles neural ones*

It&#39;s as if Elon Musk was aware of us... But www.openai.com probably wasn&#39;t. And still really isn&#39;t.

6 days ago [he announced](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/675431513211600896) the group formation. I tried joining them as soon as possible, but they&#39;re a team of &quot;just&quot; 9 folks looking only for [exceptionally experienced engineers / ai researchers](https://twitter.com/cauerego/status/677200028981702656) and I was already not selected.

Open ai is, indeed, the first group I found that&#39;s doing **Ai research** the way [we in basiux](basiux.org) believe it **should be done**, for the longest time: **open sourced and non profit**. Except, they still don&#39;t have a nice forum, for whatever reason, and so they&#39;re not really going all open just yet.

I guess I&#39;ll be doing quite some ranting after all...

But I am in fact thrilled that they now exist! First and foremost, Elon is the best guy to lead this path today. And it&#39;s awesome to realize I was **so** [aligned with his thoughts after all](https://twitter.com/cauerego/status/674026934746152960).

After that announcement (and even before), a lot of things already happened, other than media obvious and expected explosion around it. [Facebook also opened their Ai research](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/facebooks-open-sourcing-of-ai-hardware-is-the-start-of-the-deep-learning-revolution/) and [Google had done so some weeks before](http://www.wired.com/2015/11/google-open-sources-its-artificial-intelligence-engine/). Big Ai is becoming real really fast.

Only problem, in my humble opinion, is people are still clueless of what Ai even is.

I&#39;m still to see a project as good as Tamagotchi X to be made, which can bring such knowledge to people... If things keep going this fast, maybe before the end of the year some of the big guys will also make a much more polished version of it, like openai was to basiux! :blush: 

I&#39;ll have to re-invent myself once again, and I&#39;ll officially have lost that train. Probably.  And to think it all may have happened just because I didn&#39;t vote 3 times on myself, back on the startup pirates first day, idea selection... I like to think it was all to a good reason.

In any case, it is very cool to see so up close how things are happening, and I&#39;m glad to be alive in such an age in human evolution! :)</description>
