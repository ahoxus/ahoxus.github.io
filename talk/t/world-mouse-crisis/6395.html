<p>Little more than 2 years ago I've spent about 2 months looking for a good mouse. A simple good mouse that would just work.</p>

<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/8ntah36qci2ser8/2014-01-10 10.03.26 a4tech mouse (the best).jpg?dl=0" target="_blank"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/8ntah36qci2ser8/2014-01-10 10.03.26 a4tech mouse (the best).jpg?dl=0" width="375" height="500"></a>

<p>Looking back I can see I was spoiled by this amazing <a href="http://www.a4tech.com/product.asp?cid=1&amp;scid=1&amp;id=753">A4Tech "padless mouse"</a>, which I had bought previously for just about U$20 back in 2012 or so... The best cost benefit mouse I've ever seen! Just perfect for me.</p>

<p>The only problem was: I had lent it and it was nowhere to be found again. The store I had bought it had no clue of its existence. I bought 4 different ones, spent a whole lot more than I'd ever expect and ended up with no mouse. It'd have been better if I went straight to a Razer and their expensive and ugly shiny mouses full of useless buttons. At least it would work.</p>

<p>Microsoft mouse? Easy to find everywhere. They all suck. Blue tracking? Bullshit. Can't even work on a black wood table, even less on my bed - where I might need it most, sometimes. It has the same issues as any other regular cheap mouse.</p>

<p>Later on I managed to buy an used razer for equivalent of U$40, with just 2 buttons (which is 3 less buttons than the amazing a4tech), and just an annoying giant blue led, which can easily replace a dim bedside lamp, except there is no switch and the only way to turn it off is disconnecting it.</p>

<p>Anyway, anyone knows where I can find this mouse?</p>

<p>Or what would be a similarly good one?</p>
