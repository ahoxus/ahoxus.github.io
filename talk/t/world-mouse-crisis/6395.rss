    <title>World mouse crisis?</title>
    <link>/talk/t/world-mouse-crisis/6395</link>
    <description>&gt; *Originally [posted on HTG][1]* - e [aqui em português][2].

Little more than 2 years ago I&#39;ve spent about 2 months looking for a good mouse. A simple good mouse that would just work.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ntah36qci2ser8/2014-01-10%2010.03.26%20a4tech%20mouse%20%28the%20best%29.jpg?dl=0

Looking back I can see I was spoiled by this amazing [A4Tech &quot;padless mouse&quot;][3], which I had bought previously for just about U$20 back in 2012 or so... The best cost benefit mouse I&#39;ve ever seen! Just perfect for me.

The only problem was: I had lent it and it was nowhere to be found again. The store I had bought it had no clue of its existence. I bought 4 different ones, spent a whole lot more than I&#39;d ever expect and ended up with no mouse. It&#39;d have been better if I went straight to a Razer and their expensive and ugly shiny mouses full of useless buttons. At least it would work.

Microsoft mouse? Easy to find everywhere. They all suck. Blue tracking? Bullshit. Can&#39;t even work on a black wood table, even less on my bed - where I might need it most, sometimes. It has the same issues as any other regular cheap mouse.

Later on I managed to buy an used razer for equivalent of U$40, with just 2 buttons (which is 3 less buttons than the amazing a4tech), and just an annoying giant blue led, which can easily replace a dim bedside lamp, except there is no switch and the only way to turn it off is disconnecting it.

Anyway, anyone knows where I can find this mouse?

Or what would be a similarly good one?
