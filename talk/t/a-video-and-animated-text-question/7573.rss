    <title>A video and animated text question</title>
    <link>http://talk.cregox.com/t/a-video-and-animated-text-question/7573</link>
    <description>Hi, 

Please look at this page: https://clockworkstudio.squarespace.com

I have embedded the video from WISTIA (Wistia.com) based on a tip from Squarefront

&gt;     Step 1: Pick a template with an Index.
&gt;     Step 2: Add a Gallery to the Index, move it to the top-most page of the folder.
&gt;     Step 3: Add a &quot;Video&quot; to the Gallery and nothing else.
&gt;     Step 4: Upload your video to Wistia.com. Embed your video using Wistia.

This solution works ok. But can you make it so when opening a page on tablets and smartphones, this video is disabled and a &quot;static&quot; image with logo is shown?

If you have a better solution to embed video, that does not need the service from Wistia, but have the same capabilities (autoplay on load, loop, not showing any videoplayer controls etc.)

The second request is animated text. There are some lines that should be animated.
Here is a &quot;demo&quot; which is quite similar what I am looking for: codyhouse.co/demo/animated-headlines/index.html
The &quot;type&quot; example is nice.

The text that should be animated is:
1) &quot;produserer over 1500 unike filmer i året&quot;
2) &quot;5700 sendemastere&quot;
3) 21 dedikerte medarbeidere&quot;
4) 2 avdelinger
5) et stort effektivt internasjonalt nettverk
6) 1 effektivt studio

The whole sentence should be animated in and out, and we also need the flexibility of changing the sentence.

This animated text should appear on the site (Clockwork), just below &quot;clockwork er norges største og mest effektive reklamefilmstudio&quot;

Can you do this, and what is the estimated time?

Best regards, 
Tor Martin</description>

              <p>Hi again, </p>

<p>I have some "bugs" on this site caused by one of your script. <a href="https://clockworkstudio.squarespace.com/#produksjoner-cw-section" rel="nofollow">https://clockworkstudio.squarespace.com/#produksjoner-cw-section</a></p>

<p>The gallery should be shown as a 3 x 3 grid, and not as a vertical list. If you resize your browser window, the gallery works nice again.</p>

<p>I asked Squarespace support about this, and they answered:</p>

<p>Hey again Tor,</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience while we took a closer look at this on our end. Let me explain what we found so far.</p>

<p>In this case, it seems one of the code block added into the page content for the 'Folk' page is currently causing this issue. We have been able to reproduce this on one of our test sites. I've attached a video of this for your reference to this email.</p>

<p>That means, removing the code blocks within the site should allow the Summary block to work normally.</p>

<p>Could you please look at your script to see if its interferring with the galley.</p>

<p>Here is a video from squarespace support: <a href="http://we.tl/nzmOJQEbhv" rel="nofollow">http://we.tl/nzmOJQEbhv</a></p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>It is identical (almost) to clockworkstudio.squarespace.com.</p>

<p>But I cant get the gallery-function that you made to work. I have copied every script, and used the same name on folders and galleries. Could you take a quick peek just to see if there are som obvious errors?</p>

<p>I reckon I dont need the magnifier, but It could be useful to have.</p>

<p>In fact my work here is meant to be with any technology. It just happened so far my marketing only brought me squarespace work, by chance. So I haven't really got an opportunity to play much with wordpress recently.</p>

<p>That being said, the way I'm working now, the cost would probably be <em>about the same</em> <code>(*)</code>, but I could take about double the time to adapt. Except...</p>

<p><code>(*)</code> I must now admit one caveat: you were my first paying customer since I raised my price table, and I had had a few requests for a whole month without anyone willing to move forward... So I was eager to please (plus I had some extra time in hands). Meaning it's a price I probably won't be able to keep because it didn't really covered my costs. So, unfortunatelly, I'm <em>still</em> <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/the-making-of-your-home/7491/4?u=cawas">struggling</a> on how to make the whole business work.</p>

<p>Right now what I would have done is I'd take the upfront payment, analyze if I had made a proper first judgement, realize I haven't, then charge more to adjust to what I would need to do or give a full refund. And after analyzing, I should either have known it would cost around U$690 (if I properly recall, I don't really keep all my calculations around) or at least have said I wouldn't be able to move forward unless we reached an agreement to "pay as it goes".</p>

<p>And if you're wondering about moving away from squarespace in the future, there's at least one more option to consider:</p>

<p>I've put them there to <em>make sure</em> the galleries for the folks page, that should never be shown, would in fact never show. Then, when all script is done, the very last command line is this, which shows galleries that had nothing to do with it:</p>

<pre><code>    $('.sqs-gallery-container').show();</code></pre>

<p>Since the editor disables the scripts, it never brings the galleries back while on edit mode.</p>

<p>There's little I could do to go around this, if you feel it's needed... That is, short of trying to think of novel ways to achieve that or simply removing this little touch. Most people will probably never notice if the browser even ever renders the gallery. It would only show for a very brief period, which might only happen if I remove that.</p>

<p>And if I go into "edit mode", I cannot longer see the Gallery.<br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/uploads/default/96159964730737477b44014a292af87dd8121707" href="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/uploads/default/130/e8c162255c0974fd.png" class="lightbox" title="Skjermbilde 2015-05-17 kl. 22.24.23.png"><img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/uploads/default/_optimized/770/638/7a15b8d987_690x375.png" width="690" height="375"><div class="meta">

<p>The "gallery block" is there, but the preview is gone. Do you know why?</p>

<p>I've put the main code inside a Code Block on the top of the page, that way it will work only for that page, regardless if you open it <a href="http://clockworkstudio.squarespace.com/folk">directly</a> or inside an <a href="http://clockworkstudio.squarespace.com">index</a>. That code block could go into global Code Injection if you prefer. And now each gallery just need a Code Block like this before them to be activated:</p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;span class="gallery-hover-click" id="gallery-people"&gt;
  Loading next gallery found below...
&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

<p><em>( The <code>id="gallery-people"</code> there should be unique, but it's not really being used anyway. )</em></p>

<p>Two things:</p>

<p>1) Animated text need to be centered (not left aligned)</p>

<p>Guess the code below does the trick, but I am not sure how to use it correctly.</p>

<blockquote><p>div.sqs-block-content h3, h3#animated {<br>  text-align: center;<br>}</p></blockquote>

<p>2 ) Two people gallery:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another question regarding People Bio. How can I differentiate between employees at Clockwork and employees at Schjærven film?</p>
<p>You see, there at two lists with people, Clockwork and Schjærven. Could you make a new "people gallery" that has only Schjærven film employees.</p>
<p>I.e.<br>People gallery Clockwork - only people working at Clockwork</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>People galley Schjærven - only people working at Clockwork</p>
<p>I guess this would need a new code block targeting the new gallery?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could you help me with this?</p>

<p>I think we are close to an end now <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile" width="20" height="20"></p>

Now we're going to use <a href="http://help.squarespace.com/guides/using-the-markdown-block">markdown</a>! That way there's no mistake or funky HTML sqsp might generate. It is a bit more limited than squarespace regular <a href="http://help.squarespace.com/guides/using-the-text-block">text block</a> in some senses, and it does have more options in other senses. But we can style it more with Custom CSS, such as this one used to align it center:</p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">div.sqs-block-content h3, h3#animated {
  text-align: center;
}</code></pre>

<p>Also added more text to it and reduced the deletion delay so it's faster, as you asked.</p>

<p>I haven't touched people click alignment, nor have I noticed if it was left aligned before. That's weird. I've added <a href="https://github.com/cauerego/cregox-scripts/commit/c7853b1fdbac07b1e6e15410aa43a06b817e503b">a code to do it</a> anyway.</p>

<p>As for not being able to align anything else other than center (and sometimes right), this isn't happening only on <code>video_sbs</code> at all (a page I've never touched either). It's everywhere! Even on a new page. This is so much weirder than the people click alignment there... But maybe they're related. I tried removing all Custom CSS, which might be causing something, but as expected it wasn't. Quite a new bug to me and I don't think it's related to anything I've done because it looks like it appeared when I wasn't doing anything! In any case, I'll keep on investigating this.  <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>And since you've already added everyone into people gallery, I went ahead and changed the one being used before on the main page's gallery block to that one.</p>

              <p>Here's what's happening with the animated text...</p>

<p>I'm quite surprised to realize squarespace code handling behind the curtains is not quite reliable. Depending on how you write that text you can have many different results.</p>

<p>So, for now, I've just copied the text from the other page, and it's working.</p>

<p>I also tweaked a bit with the script, but that was not the issue at all. The text currently working at studio is not tweaked. But this is: <a href="http://clockworkstudio.squarespace.com/studio-weird-bug">http://clockworkstudio.squarespace.com/studio-weird-bug</a></p>

<p>Trying to explain in short technical terms, the squarespace-generated-code that do work, split each line using <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>. This weird behaviour there, however, is also code generated by squarespace but it contains no <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>. Just <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, which makes it harder to identify different paragraphs, code wise, for my code to inject text into <em>typed.js</em>.</p>

<p>All that means that to get reliable results we'll probably need to do it in another way because by keeping it this way whenever you modify the text (which you should be able to do) there's a risk it won't work. Even if I'd go ahead and write more code to account for this, I fear there might be even more issues to arise.</p>

<p>Any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">wysiwyg</a> code generator have this kind of problem, I just never realized sqsp one did have it this big.</p>

<p>Taking a look at studio text animation now... I think that's getting way more buggy than it should be. I can already see it's something related to the previous bug.</p>

              <p>Yes, lets try <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile" width="20" height="20"> I will present the site to the client tomorrow.<br>Can you help me with implementing the people click gallery also? You could just do Andre De Young, I´ll do the rest.</p>

<p>Could you also take another look at the "studio" text animation? I tried to add another sentence, "Clockwork er norges mest effektive reklamestudio^2000" But it would not animate the new sentence, it only respected the "^2000" pause.</p>

<p>And when I removed the sentence, the text animation stopped. I may have messed something up..</p>
