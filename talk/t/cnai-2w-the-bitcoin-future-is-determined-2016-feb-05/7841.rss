    <title>[CNAi 2w] the bitcoin future is determined! (2016 feb 05)</title>
    <link>/talk/t/cnai-2w-the-bitcoin-future-is-determined-2016-feb-05/7841</link>
    <description>CNAi 2w stands for &quot;codenewbie artificial intelligence biweekly&quot;, but that might change soon...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT_EXzpvwo0

when I join in around minute 11 everything slows down for a while, I was already sleepy and trying to figure out why it was so slow, and it was obviously thanks to my terrible non-fiber 0.5 mbps upstream internet here at historical lisbon center. **I promise the broadcast gets better** later on, if you enjoy artificial intelligence, science and / or philosophy.

topics touched:

- autonomous cars and tesla ( https://www.teslamotors.com/models )
- tesla and elon musk ( https://www.teslamotors.com/models )
- academia Ai
- net neutrality
- golf bot and tiger woods
- chicken or the egg ( www.basiux.org/#mariox )
- reinforced mixed learning
- bitcoins
- universe determinism

I participate in those since the first one (but unfortunately not in all of them) and I think anyone can join. this is the first one I&#39;m aware that&#39;s being broadcast, but just near the ending. `Moe` does a great job [organizing](http://timezone.io/team/codenewbieai) &#39;em and putting things together, along with [the slack channel](https://codenewbie.slack.com/archives/ai/p1454713220000253).

now, this is just in: [that hangout may](https://codenewbie.slack.com/archives/basiux) soon become [the podcast](/talk/t/lets-make-a-podcast/7753)!!
