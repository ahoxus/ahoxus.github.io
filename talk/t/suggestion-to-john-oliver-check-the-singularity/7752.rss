    <title>Suggestion to John Oliver, check the singularity</title>
    <link>http://talk.cregox.com/t/suggestion-to-john-oliver-check-the-singularity/7752</link>
    <description># This is much, much bigger than Snowden&#39;s!

In short, the singularity **is** near, Kurzweil is probably a bit crazy, but still I bet he&#39;s off on his prediction. It should happen before 2040, **maybe even before 2029**. And it could be a tremendous **existential risk to humanity**, the uprise of our next stage or, very unlikely but still possible: neither.

Let me know if you&#39;d like to [know more](http://basiux.org).

Cheers! ;)</description>

<p>In short, the singularity <strong>is</strong> near, Kurzweil is probably a bit crazy, but still I bet he's off on his prediction. It should happen before 2040, <strong>maybe even before 2029</strong>. And it could be a tremendous <strong>existential risk to humanity</strong>, the uprise of our next stage or, very unlikely but still possible: neither.</p>
