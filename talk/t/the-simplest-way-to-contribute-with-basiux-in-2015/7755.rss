    <title>The simplest way to contribute with basiux in 2015</title>
    <link>/talk/t/the-simplest-way-to-contribute-with-basiux-in-2015/7755</link>
    <description>As [posted on the quest blog](/talk/t/my-social-unfair-undervaluation-and-why-the-financial-system-is-broken/7751?u=cregox), the campaign starts with this little introduction:

&gt; Hi, I&#39;m cregox, the artificial mind of Caue Rego, still not uploaded to the cloud and living in a meat sack.

&gt; We&#39;re trying to build basiux - an engine capable to help the whole world of achieving such unimaginable things.

We&#39;ve just [updated](https://github.com/basiux/basiux.github.io/commit/de8615858ffbb5747ec308f8650f4fb02b2f0940) the website to add [our patreon campaign to basiux](http://patreon.com/cregox):

http://patreon.com/cregox

But of course, any wish to participate more will always be welcomed. Just keep on [getting well informed](/talk/t/reality-philosophy-time-mostly-about-education/7754) and then get in touch with us! :)

#edited
Just [made a typeform to ask for feedback on the patreon campaign](https://cregox.typeform.com/to/NFTkop). You can also just reply to this topic to give some feedback. 

## Every single input is much appreciated! :smile:</description>
