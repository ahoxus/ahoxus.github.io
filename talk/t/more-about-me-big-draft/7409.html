        <blockquote><p>In 2014 a friend offered me a gig for $1k to make his web page secure, he was making a simple web game that would be worth some prizes. I told him that was something I never did before, but we agreed I would do it. Then I've abandoned it in the first day, telling him I couldn't do it properly with such a short due date (about 2 weeks). Soon he found someone else who did it. Later on he showed me the final result. I was surprised I couldn't find a breach within 20 minutes, but it still took me less than 1 hour to find it, to which I could have abused and win over $1k in prizes. Instead I just told him what was the glitch, and he thanked me.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think I'll start my old ages early, by telling everyone about little stories like this.</p>
