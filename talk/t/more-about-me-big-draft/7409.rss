    <title>More about me (big draft)</title>
    <link>/talk/t/more-about-me-big-draft/7409</link>
    <description>&gt; In 2014 a friend offered me a gig for $1k to make his web page secure, he was making a simple web game that would be worth some prizes. I told him that was something I never did before, but we agreed I would do it. Then I&#39;ve abandoned it in the first day, telling him I couldn&#39;t do it properly with such a short due date (about 2 weeks). Soon he found someone else who did it. Later on he showed me the final result. I was surprised I couldn&#39;t find a breach within 20 minutes, but it still took me less than 1 hour to find it, to which I could have abused and win over $1k in prizes. Instead I just told him what was the glitch, and he thanked me.

I think I&#39;ll start my old ages early, by telling everyone about little stories like this.</description>
