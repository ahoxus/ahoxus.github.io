    <description>https://youtu.be/dfq96KjA80I I&#39;ll probably need to add this video to www.basiux.org but maybe only after finishing Mariox and making my own video about it + all of this.

Probably worth noting here 3 other pieces of literature I&#39;ve wrote about the singularity, one of which is still ongoing. Guess which one? Anyway, I just updated a *very long chain* of posts from the links below.

What you guys think about it today? 

I just started studying AI on my own few months ago and maybe the gold post for the global consciousness / archetype about it moved a lot, but I can see easy answers to all your questions there. I could only see 2 main themes. 

(1) Singularity based on Moore still looks quite possible to happen as Moore continues to be reliable even today. To me it only means that computers will get faster and at some poin…

What is "The Singularity"?

There will be a time in the near future, within this century, where computers will become much, much smarter than humans. Most specialists agree it will come. Nobody knows what it will be like. When it does come, everything that everyone were planning to do the next day shall change!
