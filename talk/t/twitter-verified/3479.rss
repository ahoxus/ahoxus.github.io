    <description>&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1412540952802_27763&quot;&gt;While searching google for &quot;&lt;em&gt;why does twitter verify accounts&lt;/em&gt;&quot; I found this &lt;a data-cke-saved-href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2014/06/24/william-shatner-twitter-verified/&quot; href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2014/06/24/william-shatner-twitter-verified/&quot;&gt;interesting peace by William Shatner: &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a data-cke-saved-href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2014/06/24/william-shatner-twitter-verified/&quot; href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2014/06/24/william-shatner-twitter-verified/&quot;&gt;http://mashable.com/2014/06/24/william-shatner-twitter-verified/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I write in a very peculiar way and often people might think I&#39;m being sarcastic. I&#39;m not. )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1412540952802_32688&quot;&gt;&quot;Verified&quot; to me should mean one thing only: twitter somehow approves such person is who they claim to be. That&#39;s all. And that could be done in a much smarter way, by letting the community regulate itself. I was hoping that was what I&#39;d read on mashable, due to its title, but instead I saw a tech savy old man talking how he would like &quot;verified&quot; should work. And I think it&#39;s all reasonable, but not tech-savy enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1412540952802_32689&quot;&gt;What he want from it? Does he just want it to be &quot;people I know&quot; to filter his home? Or does he want someone to curate &quot;very interesting smart people&quot; for serendipity? A mix of both, or something else? I just know he is being at least a bit too much of a cry baby, imho. A assumed nobody. ;P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1412540952802_32690&quot;&gt;I want to be verified by a good community system, not by this flawed twitter one. I want to be famous and considerated &quot;interesting&quot; by Shatner, and lots of other folks (couple of other cool old hags that comes to mind are Dvorak and Laporte, from twit before twitter) though I don&#39;t care that much. They won&#39;t help me pay my bills. And since I couldn&#39;t care much less about PR, twitter, facebook, and so many other social medias, I probably never will get to that point in which they&#39;d see me before I&#39;m too old for them to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1412540952802_32691&quot;&gt;I definetly don&#39;t want to make a life style out of popularity. Never did. I don&#39;t know what I do want from life. I find it easier live day by day and discover things I don&#39;t want from it. Then eventually change even those. But having my own niche of fans or clients from which I could survive doing something I love wouldn&#39;t hurt! =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1412540952802_32692&quot;&gt;I may never be polite enough even for that, though. Or optimistic enough. Who knows what choices we make can lead us to where we envision ourselves today? I only believe that the future is set in hard stone and we can only learn how to enjoy the ride (check my other blog post for more on that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1412540952802_32693&quot;&gt;Anyway... In fact, I just decided to hack my way in this &quot;verified&quot; twitter bullshit. Take a look at my new &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cauerego&quot; data-cke-saved-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cauerego&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; image on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1412540952802_28511&quot;&gt;Reason I&#39;m posting this? Just because I felt like answering him, and maybe he&#39;d read and engage in some kind of healthy discussion. That would be wicked cool. In fact, I&#39;d enjoy talking about this with anyone with similar views from him. Or anyone willing to engage, really. I&#39;m desperate! (ok, I like to think this was sarcasm)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1412540952802_28512&quot;&gt;Reason I was googling? I couldn&#39;t understand why twitter verification was so flawed. Now I think I do. Or at least I felt I didn&#39;t have to google any further. Thanks mr shatner! ;)&lt;/p&gt;
