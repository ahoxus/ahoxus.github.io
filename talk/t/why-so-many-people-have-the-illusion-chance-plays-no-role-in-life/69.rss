    <title>Why so many people have the illusion chance plays no role in life?</title>

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;/talk/t/differences-between-free-will-randomness-and-or-determinism/7804&quot;&gt;philosophy answer&lt;/a&gt; that could probably still turn out to be very unpopular on the usually difficult &lt;a href=&quot;http://cauecmrego.blogspot.com.br/2014/05/why-stack-exchange-network-rocks.html&quot;&gt;stack exchange community&lt;/a&gt; which addresses exactly this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have every reason to believe our universe is deterministic, don&#39;t we? We can already predict almost everything that happens when it does happen &quot;far enough&quot;, from macro to micro, from past to future, everything far away from our own belly&#39;s time and place is clearly very deterministic. Meanwhile, we can&#39;t predict almost anything that&#39;s too close, like a butterfly flight path or what we ate this morning, while still sleepy. Make no mistake, remembering the past triggers the same brain pathways as making futuristic predictions, for a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, we are daily eluded by mind illusions of reality. &lt;a href=&quot;http://cauecmrego.blogspot.com.br/2014/04/take-at-least-30-minutes-to-read-this.html&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt; is, at its core, a procedure to protect us from ourselves when trying to better understand reality. Do &lt;a href=&quot;http://cauecmrego.blogspot.com.br/2014/04/take-at-least-30-minutes-to-read-this.html&quot;&gt;read that link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me it&#39;s blatantly obvious free will is an illusion, the future is just as already determined as the past and we have absolutely no choice in determining our life path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That does not take away the fun out of living it! At all. I can still jump around thinking I am changing something, and it&#39;s surprisingly enjoyable to be eluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, the whole cosmos plays no dice. God plays no dice, a wise man once said. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXb6jJ1lQ_o&quot;&gt;Yes, it does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Many people today seen to believe quantum theory contradicts Einstein while, in fact, it&#39;s a subset field of study with &lt;b&gt;no consequences&lt;/b&gt; in practice up to this day and, mark my words, the day we can use quantum physics to anything, it will become deterministic. Even Newton&#39;s laws, which are by far &quot;wrong&quot; today, are actually over 99% correct. In the same way, no amount of quantum evidence can change the astonishing fact our universe is completely pre determined. And that&#39;s one huge thing that makes it so beautiful.

If there is no choice, there is also no &lt;a href=&quot;/talk/t/random-what-now/48&quot;&gt;random&lt;/a&gt; chance. When I say our life is all about luck, I simply mean we can&#39;t predict what will happen and so we call it chance. But it will happen, and it is predefined by a way too complex set of events. Way too complex. Waaaaaaay too much. If the whole Earth was a &quot;gaia&quot; like &lt;b&gt;brain&lt;/b&gt; in itself, not even then I think could it grasp how complex it is. No one can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can define the universe as uniquely set and understand the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now there is a space body out there that will hit Earth in the future and exterminate whatever we call life in it. Again. Life around here would at least 90% extinct for the 6th time. Right now there are also other smaller bodies out there that will reach the Earth surface and make no damage at all - we may only notice it if it hits someone in the head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise lesser dense materials are triggering everything else that happens. Including in our neurons. As I type, you read, and our minds create an amazing illusion of time passing, we can then glance this piece of cosmos and enjoy our existence in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? It isn&#39;t too hard to keep coming up with logical reasons, or even factual based ones. No matter if they will keep changing and improving upon new evidence, it only matters if they help you building up a good story in your mind to set it at ease and live for today.&lt;/p&gt;
