    <title>Standing Invitation</title>
    <link>/talk/t/standing-invitation/7407</link>
    <description>This is for [Patrick][1], the dude [who says he loves to get emails (the invitation)][2].

I just found you thanks to an indication [from Joe][3] and started [reading your site][4]. I&#39;m still on it and got a long way to go - haven&#39;t even **completely** finished [your most popular and awesome blog post there][5] (though I did read almost all of it).

I also I read you love receiving emails (right there on the front page), so I decided to write early on anyway:

&gt; Feel free to send me an email at patrick@kalzumeus.com for just about any reason.  I love talking to other small businesses at any time, for any reason: please, drop me an email.

I, at other hand, prefer public places rather than emails. Because other than my passwords, I don&#39;t have any data that&#39;s sensitive enough in need of privacy. And because I love to share. So, if you&#39;re able to respond this and you&#39;re willing to continue, please choose your prefered method. You already know mine. ;)

**So, I&#39;m not even sure why I&#39;m writing you...**

I guess I just wanted to say &quot;hi&quot;.
---

Also I think you should implement [discourse][6] to your site! ;P

**In fact...**

I would have so many questions, looking for experienced advices. Because your writing is, as you say, pretty convincing. But, from your &quot;faq&quot;:

&gt; **I am thinking of starting my own mISV. Any advice?** Scads. Either send me an email with specific questions or just start reading the archives. I rather recommend starting at the back and continuing forward.

So I&#39;ll make just one **very specific question**: I am currently looking for partners and angels other than a job. I&#39;m thinking in making a video [a tiny bit like ME][7] and try to viralize it to pitch for investors. *Do you think it&#39;s a good idea?* Despite having [some expertise][8] into &quot;film making&quot; in general, I am not so sure.

Of course that&#39;s far from my only plan and that&#39;s not even all there is about it, so if you&#39;re looking to read more, maybe you could start here:

/talk/t/telling-my-story/417/2?u=cawas

And there: www.cregox.com/aboutto which I just included a small story about myself.

Just saw (not read) your post about [reliable websites][9]... Is it older than squarespace (wow, I just found about [ceros][10] as well, [serendipitly][11], which is actually obviously newer) and such? Maybe you should update it. Or maybe I should just read it. :P
