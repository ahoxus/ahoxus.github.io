        <p>This is for <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/about/">Patrick</a>, the dude <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/">who says he loves to get emails (the invitation)</a>.</p>

<p>I just found you thanks to an indication <a href="http://discourse.codenewbie.org/users/joe_astuccio">from Joe</a> and started <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/start-here-if-youre-new/">reading your site</a>. I'm still on it and got a long way to go - haven't even <strong>completely</strong> finished <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">your most popular and awesome blog post there</a> (though I did read almost all of it).</p>

<p>I also I read you love receiving emails (right there on the front page), so I decided to write early on anyway:</p>

<blockquote><p>Feel free to send me an email at patrick@kalzumeus.com for just about any reason.  I love talking to other small businesses at any time, for any reason: please, drop me an email.</p></blockquote>

<p>I, at other hand, prefer public places rather than emails. Because other than my passwords, I don't have any data that's sensitive enough in need of privacy. And because I love to share. So, if you're able to respond this and you're willing to continue, please choose your prefered method. You already know mine. <img src="http://talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p><strong>So, I'm not even sure why I'm writing you...</strong></p>

<h2>I guess I just wanted to say "hi".</h2>

<p>Also I think you should implement <a href="http://discourse.org/">discourse</a> to your site! <img src="http://talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p><strong>In fact...</strong></p>

<p>I would have so many questions, looking for experienced advices. Because your writing is, as you say, pretty convincing. But, from your "faq":</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>I am thinking of starting my own mISV. Any advice?</strong> Scads. Either send me an email with specific questions or just start reading the archives. I rather recommend starting at the back and continuing forward.</p></blockquote>

<p>So I'll make just one <strong>very specific question</strong>: I am currently looking for partners and angels other than a job. I'm thinking in making a video <a href="http://googlepleasehire.me/">a tiny bit like ME</a> and try to viralize it to pitch for investors. <em>Do you think it's a good idea?</em> Despite having <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/f6f674e14c/just-a-regular-damme-day">some expertise</a> into "film making" in general, I am not so sure.</p>

<p>Of course that's far from my only plan and that's not even all there is about it, so if you're looking to read more, maybe you could start here:</p>

<aside class="quote" data-topic="417" data-slug="telling-my-story" data-post="2"><div class="title">

<img width="20" height="20" src="http://talk-cdn.cregox.com/user_avatar/talk.cregox.com/cawas/40/30.png" class="avatar">Cawas:</div>
<blockquote><p>Few days ago I decided even this food seeker idea is too much for a next step.   So now I'm thinking about building either <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/17273607/" rel="nofollow">some kind of simple game</a> (or maybe some kind of <a href="http://cregox.com/esfi" rel="nofollow">esfi</a>) and/or an introductory video seeking for investment, like <a href="http://googlepleasehire.me/" rel="nofollow">that guy who did it for google</a>.   You see, I could use a good scholarship and I'm on the latest age I could get one. Instead of going to college with that money it, though, I'd spend it on expenses to focus in one thing only: get my project done (food seekers). 4 yâ€¦</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>And there: <a href="http://www.cregox.com/aboutto">www.cregox.com/aboutto</a> which I just included a small story about myself.</p>

<hr>

<p>Just saw (not read) your post about <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/04/20/building-highly-reliable-websites-for-small-companies/">reliable websites</a>... Is it older than squarespace (wow, I just found about <a href="http://www.ceros.com/about">ceros</a> as well, <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/80460/qa-test-automation-engineer-100-remote-ceros?a=qYZGmiu4rDy&amp;searchTerm=100%25%20remote">serendipitly</a>, which is actually obviously newer) and such? Maybe you should update it. Or maybe I should just read it. <img src="http://talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue" width="20" height="20"></p>
