<p>That triggered me to do some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie">wikipedia</a> reading, all on the mobile. IMHO, he was luckily born in an easy place to live, enjoyed financial freedom for ever, plus quickly figured out what sex and religion is all about in his heart - i.e. he wasn't tainted by all his freedom and did manage to set his mind in the right place - unlike most people especially in famous positions as his.</p>

<p>Dying 2 days after being 69 on top of it all? Such a meaningful number with the most common cause of death in the recent days? If I were living his life and had to choose a time and place to die, I couldn't do any better. <img src="http://talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=1" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
