    <title>Using a gallery instead of the template banner</title>
    <link>/talk/t/using-a-gallery-instead-of-the-template-banner/7476</link>
    <description>Hey @Kate, remember this list we agreed on making item 2?

1. You want a picture or a video on top header? That should be U$ 42
2. You want a gallery on top header? U$ 210
3. You want a different gallery on top header for each page? U$ 294

Well, it so happened I had a different picture of what you wanted, and for what I now think you need it would be actually even simpler.

I was thinking on moving the gallery on top of the header, not the page banner. So, item 3 is moot and I&#39;ll probably finish early...

Please do verify this is almost what you want and bring on what else you need to change there. I would only make its height automatically big enough so we can see the video controls (which already happens on screen width 640px).

I also still need to fix a few glitches I&#39;ve noticed there... But it&#39;s almost ready already, as you hopefully could see there! :)</description>

              <p>You think there's any way around it? Would it be worth trying javascript to tell the browser to replace these gifs with new ones every 5 seconds after preloading them, so it looks seamless to add in more?</p>

<p>Maybe that would be a lot of work?</p>

              <p>Well, I have uncommented the script code which was already set to make it work with <code>'/shopproducts'</code> page as pointed out, and it's already working. I also went ahead and removed the old static banner from shopproducts. But you still need to set up the gallery or tell me how you want it.</p>

<p>The issue I mentioned with chrome and footers is coincidental, not related to any custom scripts at all, related strictly to squarespace and, maybe, it's just in my end. I'm in touch with them to report the bug. I just cited it because it would be funny if you ended up having the same bug! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>My bad yet again on the lightbox bug. The fix was basically using a <code>for each</code> instead of <code>if ($videoButton.length)</code>. That code is fairly simple, not very hackish or particularly difficult to maintain, despite its apparent big size.</p>

<p>But I agree with you. If we need so much more than a couple small scripts, it's probably a better idea to go with developer mode!</p>

<p>I appreciate your response on the footer, at this point, I am hoping you could set up whatever code needs to be in the shop page for me to be able to edit the slideshow banner, as I cannot access it on my end and the client was expecting it up!

The video light box is working for the “why Lumixyl" Button, but not for the “why silk peel". In the gallery, the right URL is input for the silk peel video, however, when clicked it plays the Lumixyl video. Additionally, under the sWhy silk peel button the thumbnail of the video displays where it should not</p>

<p>Next go-around, we will not make things so hacker like…</p>

              <p>As you requested <a class="mention" href="/users/kate">@Kate</a>, I've also done the lightbox now. And had <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/29084305/274502">some fun</a> while at it. It's all on:</p>

<p><a href="https://kate-bosse-87i3.squarespace.com/video-button" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://kate-bosse-87i3.squarespace.com/video-button</a></p>

<p>To use it, you just have to add this URL (instead of the video URL) to the button and a Gallery right after it:</p>

<pre><code>javascript:jqueryLightbox();</code></pre>

<p>Take a look on the squarespace config how I setup that page. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>The gallery has to be a <strong>grid</strong>, as that the only one that makes the lightbox <a href="http://answers.squarespace.com/questions/4182/how-can-i-lightbox-an-embedded-video-full-screen-without-coding">precisely the way we wanted</a> (I hope), as <a href="http://answers.squarespace.com/questions/4182/how-can-i-lightbox-an-embedded-video-full-screen-without-coding">discussed before</a>. Here's a video on how you can include one:</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="AOZdYsI46NE" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

<p>And this is the full code I've used:</p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;script author="cregox.com"&gt;
  $(window).load(function(){
    var $videoButton = $('.button-block a[href^="javascript:jqueryLightbox()"]');
    var $galleryLightbox = $videoButton.findNext('.sqs-block-gallery');
    $galleryLightbox.hide();
    $videoButton.click(function(){
      $galleryLightbox.find('img').click();
    });
    $videoButton.attr('href', 'javascript:');
    $videoButton.addClass('lightboxed');
  });
  
  function jqueryLightbox () {
    alert('jQuery not loaded');
  }
  
  (function( $ ){
   $.fn.findNext = function(sel) {
     var $result = $(sel).first();
     if ($result.length &lt;= 0) {
       return $result;
     }
     $result = [];
     var thisIndex = $('*').index($(this));
     var selIndex = Number.MAX_VALUE;
     $(sel).each(function(i,val){
       var valIndex = $('*').index($(val));
       if (thisIndex &lt; valIndex &amp;&amp; valIndex &lt; selIndex) {
         selIndex = valIndex;
         $result = $(val);
       }
     });
     return $result;
   }; 
  })( jQuery );
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p>PS: I've also added a small bug fix to a previous code which was affecting this one. Basically it was adding couple of checking for nulls, such as <code>if ($gal.length)</code>. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Things like that happen at least once per month, just not in the last minute like that. Designers (which I am not, unfortunately) probably go to much worse, since their software is even more complex and they can do so little about it.</p>

              <p>I prefer bluntness and boldness, please keep going with it!</p>

<p>If that's what you wanted you should have told me in the beginning.</p>

<p>It might have been better...</p>

<p>Because I'm afraid the (closest to) worst have happened. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/frowning.png?v=0" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt="frowning" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>I woke up today by 7 am and I've been fiddling with this since then. Now I really need to go and I may not be able to finish this today (which was our due date).</p>

<p>For the first few hours I was trying to research new topics to get the best result possible there, using AJAX. It didn't work and I decided to move on before timing out.</p>

<p>Then I went back to my first plan and the first thing I thought about doing, which was adding the gallery block anywhere in the page (only place that's possible for a Shop Page is on the footer) and then simply moving it to the banner place. That should be simple enough. And it kind of was, but...</p>

<p>For whatever reason I couldn't find out, I can't make it rendering work as it should!</p>

<p>Right now, if you go to <a href="https://kate-bosse-87i3.squarespace.com/shop-footer">https://kate-bosse-87i3.squarespace.com/shop-footer</a> and manually resize the window, it will be perfect. That's what I had done hours ago, after just a few moments adding a few tricks for doing that. It's not ideal, but it works.</p>

<p>The problem is if you do not resize the window after it's loaded, it will stay as small as it was on the footer. And after hours trying to fix it in every possible way, I couldn't. I just couldn't. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/cry.png?v=0" title=":cry:" class="emoji" alt="cry" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>It's as frustrating as it can be. Such a minor detail, and so close to the end, but what a road block! It's almost like taking the ladder to go upstairs in a tower only to get there with closed windows and no keys. And the keys are nowhere to be found, no matter where you look or how many times you go up and down seeking for them. They might, in fact, not even exist... And the windows might, in fact, be just really good paint on the wall that tricked me really well.</p>

<p>I will try to come up with some idea later on today, if I'm able to get back at time, or in the next days to come.</p>

<p>You see, programming in such complex environments sometimes require a simple idea. Other times experience can help. And I'm good with having ideas and I do have years of experience specifically with this kind of script... But today nothing of that and not even plenty of time was enough. And it might be something impossible to do, squarespace is limited like that, there are things we just can't do. I still can't believe this would be one of those...</p>

<p>(---...---)</p>

<p>And then... <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/29037454/274502">Someone did manage to help me finding the answer</a>! Just awesome (after being almost 7 hours on this, maybe 4 just on this minor "key")!</p>

<p><strong>It's there, it's done</strong>. It's not as good as the first solution but in the end it looks as simple as you probably expected.</p>

<p>You have to edit the left footer and whatever gallery you set there will be the banner on every page that's on the script configuration (<code>allowedPagesForFooterBanner</code>). So yeah, you have to manually add which pages you want to the script before it will work. And it is just 1 gallery per global setting this way, no way to customize per page, but you can still use the old method.</p>

<p>I hope I'm not missing anything this time. I really gotta go now! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink" width="20" height="20"></p>

              <p>Hi Caue, </p>

<p>I have another request from the client on the same site (basis med)<br>Right now I have buttons set up for linking the viewer to certain videos. For example, here is a button under "Lumixyl" called "video: why lumixyl" on this page: <a href="https://kate-bosse-87i3.squarespace.com/our-products-1/" rel="nofollow">https://kate-bosse-87i3.squarespace.com/our-products-1/</a></p>

<p>The client would like for the videos on their site to display kind of like an image would if it were a lightbox where when you click it, it comes up on the screen without directing you to an outside source, like youtube. <br>Is it possible to make all the videos "pop up" like this? If so, would you have to write code and what would the cost be?</p>

              <p>The email in feature here in these forums have many good points but some limitations. <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/text-of-forwarded-emails-dont-show-up-in-posts/23155">It will filter out quotes from emails</a> in an attempt to reduce the noise. Try clicking the mail icon on your post above and you'll see how much it was filtered there. <strong>Maybe</strong> that was the issue you've experienced there. I've got no sign of your response anywhere, though.</p>

<p>As for the shop, actually, I just managed to solve that issue in a very simple way, which brings many better points and just 1 worse point (I can see) upon what we can do with the Shop Page. I've made a new page for each category (actually I've made just 2 so you can see it working). Then add all them to a folder.</p>

<p>The only problem is it's not as automated to manage categories, as you'd need to manually create each page as you create new categories for instance.</p>

<p>As the advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>This way, the shop page is much more customizable, as you can add any block as like in any page.</li>
<li>The categories can be listed on the menu</li>
<li>You can easily add different gallery banners for each category (if I do it for page, it will be just 1 gallery per category, unless I work on making it more hackish)</li>
<li>It requires less custom code to work with the "gallery banner" I've just created (means less maintenance of that code for both of us)</li>
<li>(advantage only for me) it won't require me to create more code right now <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue" width="20" height="20">
</li>
</ul>

<p>That last point, in fact, is a bit subjective, but my point there is I want you to be happy with my work. Since we're working in an agile manner, we haven't really agreed exactly how the banner should show up on the shop and I (now) think this is a perfectly fine manner (except for the only disadvantage point there).</p>

<p>What I mean is, if that bad point is no big issue for you (it wouldn't be for me if I didn't need to keep changing categories) it will be better for both of us to use Regular Page instead of Products Page. If it is a big issue for you, then I will get back to it and make it work there.</p>

<p>But there is a chance it will take <strong>much</strong> more time for me to do it and if it does I think it will be fair to charge a bit more.</p>

<p>If it doesn't take that <strong>much more extra</strong>, it's only fair for me to do it within the planned cost, because I did overlook that issue. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Another thing I might consider doing instead would be coding for changing categories of the Summary Block within the same Page. If it's possible and if it takes less code than the other option.</p>
