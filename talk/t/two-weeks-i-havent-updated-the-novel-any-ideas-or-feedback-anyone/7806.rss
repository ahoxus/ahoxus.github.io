[This is the first release](http://blog.cregox.com/2015/12/26/the-next-ai-poca-lips.html) and then I [announced](http://blog.cregox.com/2015/12/27/making-of-the-next-ai-poca-lips.html) moving it to the [wiki, where it now stays](https://github.com/cauerego/cauerego.github.io/wiki/a-novel).

Although I haven&#39;t touched *the novel* in 2 weeks, [the making of](https://github.com/cauerego/cauerego.github.io/wiki/a-novel-about-the-other-novel) have been a bit updated in just little more than 1 week and I have written 2 stories since then as well, [one about traveling](http://blog.cregox.com/2015/12/31/cregox-navigator-around-the-world.html) and the other one [trying to make comedy](http://blog.cregox.com/2016/01/05/what-s-wrong-with-bars-and-drinks.html), which should also be done in *the novel*.

I think I can&#39;t find any more inspiration / energy right now with the almost zero amount of feedback I&#39;m getting - other than those astonishing and glamouring kindest words from a new friend, of course. &quot;*The guy who will make the new Matrix*&quot; he said, and he wasn&#39;t joking nor being silly.

Well, yeah, I think that sums it up. So. I&#39;ll repeat my echoing message from other posts in this abandoned ghost town... Anyone there?

I guess I just forgot about one of my latest posts! :stuck_out_tongue:
