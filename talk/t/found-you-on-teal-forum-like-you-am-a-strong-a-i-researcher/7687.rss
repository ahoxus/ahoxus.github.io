Subject: Found you on Teal Forum...like you am a strong A.I. researcher

Message: Hello Caue :) I wanted to reach out because I too have been
working on strong A.I. for the last 25 years, I&#39;ve got 35 years development
experience, and I have recently joined the Teal Organisation forum, which
is where I saw your posting on A.I. You can find a little more about me at
http://metaera.com and also at my LinkedIn profile under &quot;Ken Kopelson&quot;.

              <p>That's huge, Ken!</p>

<p>I'm on <a href="/talk/t/thanks-to-mari-o-time-to-focus-on-ai/7653">AI for less than 2 months</a>, and got "just" 15 years of experience as <a href="/talk/t/yeah-im-also-a-progammer/7676">progammer*</a>.</p>

<p><em>Metaera</em> looks like a great concept for a startup (it is a startup, isn't it?) although I think that landing page will probably <em>not</em> work very well as an MVP. You'd need something much more aggressive, like <a href="http://thegrid.io">the grid</a> or better than the best kickstarters, IMHO.</p>

<p>We definitely should talk! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"></p>
