    <title>Could you help with building a site like this?</title>

    <description>Please look at this site: http://maaemo.no

It has some very Squarespace looking design, but the scrolling effects is very nice. Also the video in the background in a nice effect.

We are planning a new site for a photographer, and the Maaemo site is a good reference both in design, structure and how the menu is done. It misses a nice way to show a galley, but I reckon that could be implemented.

Is a site like this something you could help us with, and could you say something about price and time?

<p>And a military drone sounds very scary! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Reading again, sounds like a video for "showing what whatever is capable off" won't be really good as a background... I believe a background video should be smooth, discrete and soundless. But, well, I can imagine even such video giving hints on "what something is capable off". <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>PS: Enjoy the costs while they're at that. By next week I shall increase them.</p>

<p>The client is now roaming the net for inspiration, and will send me more examples. <br>I'll address you again when the client shows me some gallery references.</p>

<p>But, what would the cost be if I only need an embedded video background? (This is for another client who work with non military drones) I reckon a video would be nice on a site to show of what filming with drone is capable off.</p>

<p>I agree, beautiful website, remembers a lot the looks of squarespace, except squarespace would be static (no animations or videos) as of today.</p>

<p>I would <strong>love</strong> to make a squarespace website look like that! I'm not limited to using squarespace at all. That's only my biggest expertise. We could look for other tools if you want... I just really doubt it will be nearly as good. There aren't many options and I've tried a few (namely weebly, strikingly and wix), and some of them offer other features, such as background video or a more complete ecommerce solution. They do not offer, however, all the "background" features. Those are apparently minor details but they sum up in the end.</p>

<p>Also, squarespace already have a nice gallery, so that would require no work from me.</p>

<p>Here's a quote of what I could do to start with (which is in fact everything I believe is needed to add to squarespace to get to same results):</p>

<ul>
<li>add a full background video</li>
<li>set such a scroll animation for every element on the page</li>
<li>make the side menu animation and the top of screen book table animation</li>
</ul>

<p>That should be less than U$ 595 and I could deliver 1 week after getting 50% upfront and <a href="http://help.squarespace.com/guides/managing-contributor-permissions">admin access</a>. If you want just 1 item, I could make it for less than U$ 213 and I would need my minimum of U$ 91 upfront.</p>

<p>And, just to be clear, this is a plus I'll do included in anything:</p>

<ul><li>make all that responsive (work good in all sizes, like maemo already is)</li></ul>
