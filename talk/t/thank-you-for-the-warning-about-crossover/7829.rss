Hi,
Sorry if I&#39;m bothering you, I just wanted to say THANK YOU, because I was
going to spend 3 Days, of my life doing that stupid project. I also was
thinking of leaving my job if I get accepted (I read somewhere that even if
you get in there is a chance that you don&#39;t get paid if you are not looking
directly at the screen when you are working..WTF).

Again just wanted to thank you very much.
BTW have a look at my blog kujtimhoxha.com.

Best regards,
Kujtim Hoxha

<p>Aha, now I could <a href="http://kujtimhoxha.com/">see your</a> fun geeky quote for life. Here's my little "fork":</p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">illusion = 0

async choice:
    result = 0.34 * random * illusion
    delay 8  # seconds
    return result

Life:
    born = 0.33 * random  # either 0 or 1
    happy = random
    dead = random
 
    while not dead:
        illusion = random  # perception
        luck = 0.33 * random * illusion
        happy = (born + luck + choice) &gt; 0.5 # is the glass half full?
        dead = random</code></pre>

              <p>You're welcome, but... I <em>think</em> you probably haven't read the whole review.</p>

<p>Crossover is actually a very decent company. They're just struggling to a booming growth and trying to get on their feet in a kinda desperate (imho) attempt to make things right. I will still apply and, luckily, work there in a meaningful role, even if only for 1 month or one year.</p>

<p>BTW your site doesn't work nor google links to your blog! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/frowning.png?v=1" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>Cheers. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slightly_smiling.png?v=1" title=":slightly_smiling:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling:"></p>
