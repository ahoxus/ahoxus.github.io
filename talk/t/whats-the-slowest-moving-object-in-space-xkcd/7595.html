        <p>Hey crazy Randall!</p>

<p>The first question that triggered this little quest of mine, I actually asked just yesterday, when I saw an airplane very close by while going to lunch near an airport:</p>

<blockquote><p>Why can't an airplane simply fly into space?</p></blockquote>

<p>That was promptly answered by NASA: <a href="http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-technology/rockets.html">http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-technology/rockets.html</a></p>

<p>Then I went to some reading to get to the <em>question in the title</em>, namely:<br>- <a href="https://www.quora.com/Aerospace-and-Aeronautical-Engineering/Why-cant-an-aircraft-fly-conventionally-then-switch-to-rockets-to-get-into-space">https://www.quora.com/Aerospace-and-Aeronautical-Engineering/Why-cant-an-aircraft-fly-conventionally-then-switch-to-rockets-to-get-into-space</a><br>- <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/">https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/</a> (<strong>obligatory</strong> read, for this topic)<br>- <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/24/">https://what-if.xkcd.com/24/</a> (<strong>obligatory</strong> read, for this topic)<br>- <a href="https://gmjunior.wordpress.com/tag/xkcd/">https://gmjunior.wordpress.com/tag/xkcd/</a><br>- <a href="http://space.stackexchange.com/questions/5531/why-arent-all-satellite-carrying-rockets-launched-from-airplanes">http://space.stackexchange.com/questions/5531/why-arent-all-satellite-carrying-rockets-launched-from-airplanes</a></p>

<p>( The xkcd comics I found because I remembered about "what if" and googled for <code>xkcd aircraft rocket</code>. NASA and quora I found while asking google questions along my first one quoted there. )</p>

<p>I do realize <strong>now</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>An aircraft can't just fly away, for one, because it lifts from the ground depending on air and there's no air in space. Simple as that.</p></li>
<li><p>Most things out of earth orbit are moving very very fast. Earth is at 30 km/s, ISS at 7, Moon at 3, which is still considerably faster than what's required to launch something into space, which would be 2 km/s as you said.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I take it all those speeds are relative to the Sun, which by its turn is 200 km/s relative to galaxy center. So I suppose a 0 km/s standing body on Earth is actually moving between 170 and 230 km/s relative to galaxy center and so, all object speeds are relative.</p>

<p>But, I wanted to <em>draw a mental picture</em>, in a way, of space objects in our galaxy. So objects relative to the Sun, as that's closer to any kind of Astronaut anyone living today will ever be. What's the slowest moving object <em>there</em> and how far from Earth, and from the other planets, does it need to be so it could be considered moving at 0km/s relative to the Sun? I mean, so it won't be dragged by any planet's or asteroid's gravity.</p>

<p>Do we know if there is any such slow object around here?</p>

<p>And, to address a bit more the first question in yet another "novel" way, of course we could build something to take objects into space that doesn't require flying or fuel: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/michaellaine/space-elevator-science-climb-to-the-sky-a-tethered/description">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/michaellaine/space-elevator-science-climb-to-the-sky-a-tethered/description</a></p>

<p>At this point, I decided to google for <code>xkcd slowest object space</code> and came around yet another what-if: <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/86/">https://what-if.xkcd.com/86/</a> (<strong>obligatory</strong> read). And another cool funny one: <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/20/">https://what-if.xkcd.com/20/</a> (non obligatory).</p>

<p>There (on 86) you say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As far as moving through the Solar System goes, Voyager 1 is one of the slowest manmade objects.[2] It's moving at an average speed of about 16 km/s, which is barely half of the Earth's orbital speed around the Sun.</p>
<p>[2] It's not the <em>very</em> slowestâ€”that title might belong to the <em>Galileo</em> spacecraft. On September 6th, 1996 at 10:57 (UT), <em>Galileo's</em> speed relative to the Sun dropped to 276 meters per second (618 mph), making it possibly the slowest manmade object in Solar System history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, 0.276 km/s is quite slow compared to all the rest, but it's still far from 0.</p>

<p>Now, why do you say 16 km/s is "one of the slowest" (but by measures in this topic, I find it still quite fast) and then compare it to something over 50 times slower?!</p>

<p>And this triggered me into yet another new, but still relevant question:</p>

<ul><li><strong>What's the minimum speed an object need to be to eject the solar system?</strong></li></ul>

<p>Given the speed relative to Earth to eject it is 2 km/s.</p>
