    <title>What&#39;s the slowest moving object in space, xkcd?</title>

    <description>Hey crazy Randall!

The first question that triggered this little quest of mine, I actually asked just yesterday, when I saw an airplane very close by while going to lunch near an airport:

&gt; Why can&#39;t an airplane simply fly into space?

That was promptly answered by NASA: http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-technology/rockets.html

Then I went to some reading to get to the *question in the title*, namely:
- https://www.quora.com/Aerospace-and-Aeronautical-Engineering/Why-cant-an-aircraft-fly-conventionally-then-switch-to-rockets-to-get-into-space
- https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/ (**obligatory** read, for this topic)
- https://what-if.xkcd.com/24/ (**obligatory** read, for this topic)
- https://gmjunior.wordpress.com/tag/xkcd/
- http://space.stackexchange.com/questions/5531/why-arent-all-satellite-carrying-rockets-launched-from-airplanes

( The xkcd comics I found because I remembered about &quot;what if&quot; and googled for `xkcd aircraft rocket`. NASA and quora I found while asking google questions along my first one quoted there. )

I do realize **now**:

1. An aircraft can&#39;t just fly away, for one, because it lifts from the ground depending on air and there&#39;s no air in space. Simple as that.

2. Most things out of earth orbit are moving very very fast. Earth is at 30 km/s, ISS at 7, Moon at 3, which is still considerably faster than what&#39;s required to launch something into space, which would be 2 km/s as you said.

I take it all those speeds are relative to the Sun, which by its turn is 200 km/s relative to galaxy center. So I suppose a 0 km/s standing body on Earth is actually moving between 170 and 230 km/s relative to galaxy center and so, all object speeds are relative.

But, I wanted to *draw a mental picture*, in a way, of space objects in our galaxy. So objects relative to the Sun, as that&#39;s closer to any kind of Astronaut anyone living today will ever be. What&#39;s the slowest moving object *there* and how far from Earth, and from the other planets, does it need to be so it could be considered moving at 0km/s relative to the Sun? I mean, so it won&#39;t be dragged by any planet&#39;s or asteroid&#39;s gravity.

Do we know if there is any such slow object around here?

And, to address a bit more the first question in yet another &quot;novel&quot; way, of course we could build something to take objects into space that doesn&#39;t require flying or fuel: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/michaellaine/space-elevator-science-climb-to-the-sky-a-tethered/description

At this point, I decided to google for `xkcd slowest object space` and came around yet another what-if: https://what-if.xkcd.com/86/ (**obligatory** read). And another cool funny one: https://what-if.xkcd.com/20/ (non obligatory).

There (on 86) you say:

&gt; As far as moving through the Solar System goes, Voyager 1 is one of the slowest manmade objects.[2] It&#39;s moving at an average speed of about 16 km/s, which is barely half of the Earth&#39;s orbital speed around the Sun.

&gt; [2] It&#39;s not the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; slowest—that title might belong to the &lt;em&gt;Galileo&lt;/em&gt; spacecraft. On September 6th, 1996 at 10:57 (UT), &lt;em&gt;Galileo&#39;s&lt;/em&gt; speed relative to the Sun dropped to 276 meters per second (618 mph), making it possibly the slowest manmade object in Solar System history.&lt;/span&gt;

So, 0.276 km/s is quite slow compared to all the rest, but it&#39;s still far from 0.

Now, why do you say 16 km/s is &quot;one of the slowest&quot; (but by measures in this topic, I find it still quite fast) and then compare it to something over 50 times slower?!

And this triggered me into yet another new, but still relevant question:

- **What&#39;s the minimum speed an object need to be to eject the solar system?**

Given the speed relative to Earth to eject it is 2 km/s.</description>
