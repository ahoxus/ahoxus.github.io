<p>I doubt this is it, but it sounds very much like a song played by some bottled gas vending trucks here in Brazil.</p>

<p>More than trying to get it right, I wanted to share this little story about that song...</p>

<p>My father invented, created and produced this solution to increase the bottled gas company sales. He then came up with this idea to replace the trucks horns with a nice song. After some years of research, he came up with this, around 1990:</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="lP_79NLIYbg" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

<p>The original song had an actual better quality, with a good sound equipment. It was played by a small microchipped system, one of the first "computers" on board back then, to keep the quality up and to prevent truckers to play it more than once every 2 minutes. At least that's the story I recall... <img src="http://talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>It was so successful that there came the pirates. Many people (at least in this country) now know his idea only thanks to the very annoying pirate which plays a pour elise version that sounds pretty much like that one you played on <a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/468">episode #468</a></p>
