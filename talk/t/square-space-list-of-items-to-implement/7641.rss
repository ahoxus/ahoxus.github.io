Hi -

We are using SquareSpace for our mobile site (Momentum Template).  We have a few custom tweaks we want to make for the page and would like a quote to implement the following items:

-Reduce the space between lines for single items in the mobile menu.

-Compress folders in the mobile menu (plus to expand)

-Move the Nav bar to the bottom of the screen for mobile site only

-Loop gallery (have arrow on last image to loop to the beginning of the gallery)

-Use + sign instead of info sign (i in circle)

-Remove header/header space on pages

-Keep gallery view background opaque with menus still transparent.

 

Please let me know if these items are possible as well as a quote for how long it would take.

 

Thank you,

Meghann

              <p>For info on how I work, prices and how long it can take, please do read carefully <a href="http://www.cregox.com/your-home">www.cregox.com/your-home</a> and let me know if it's clear enough.</p>

<p>Most of those items are a matter of implementing <em>CSS</em>, very possible stuff.</p>

<p>The arrow on last image to loop into beginning of gallery is a <em>script for gallery</em>, which I'd do in <em>jQuery</em>. Also possible, but changing any gallery behaviour is always quite complicated, partially because squarespace is still using <em>YUI</em>.</p>

<p>Moving the nav bar could be complex, I'll only know once I try.</p>

<p>The only point I'm not sure what you want is "plus to expand" because you say "compress". I suppose you mean making the mobile menu disappear like it happens in other templates into a compact hamburger menu button. That also could turn to be complex and I'll have to do it to know.</p>

<p>So, I believe I'd spend anything between 1 hour and 3 hours, but that's just an estimate.</p>

<p>Ideally you'd <a href="http://cregox.com/pay">pay</a> me for 3 hours ( U$ 369 ) and we'd go from there.</p>

<p>Let me know if you want a video.</p>

<p>If you want me to work straight on squarespace I'd <a href="http://help.squarespace.com/guides/managing-contributor-permissions">need admin access</a> and can only offer 50% refund.</p>

<p>In other case you either have to implement it yourself or may need to pay extra time for me to do it.</p>

<p>Hope to hear from you! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile" width="20" height="20"></p>
