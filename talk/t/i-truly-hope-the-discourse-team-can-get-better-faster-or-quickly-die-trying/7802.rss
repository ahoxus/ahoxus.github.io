*uncalled &quot;xango&quot; sherlock for uncalled bugs - meaning [there are many bugs](https://what.thedailywtf.com/t/the-doing-it-wrong-of-the-discojuice-huffing-dude/53070/349?u=cregox) that could have &quot;easily&quot; been fixed had the only team that can really do it make any priority out of fixing bugs*

&lt;small&gt;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;only reason I didn&#39;t post this on [spoilers](/c/spoilers) first...&lt;/summary&gt; is just to be 100% sure I can backup most of everything I&#39;ve done in discourse first, starting with meta - they&#39;re just not reliable at all and meta backup was, surprise surprise, completely bugged yesterday. I&#39;ll have to wait until they fix it some day or find other backup tools. today it&#39;s mostly done.&lt;/details&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Forget the fact discourse is filled with little annoying ***uncalled** bugs*. Or that Jeff is probably a much more spoiled kid than you may ever believe.

There&#39;s actually not much to be said here, as much as linked to, so this shall be a short and repetitive post... Trying to emphasize.

---

**This** shall become Discourse&#39;s downfall, like it was with Stack Overflow. **Censorshipping**.

Yeah, you read it right. They&#39;re doing it **heavily**.

Probably biggest, maybe only reason why, lately, I have been growing faster and faster less and less fond of discourse (and Jeff + Sam).

# Meta discourse censors everything!

This means they, the team who created and open sourced discourse, can&#39;t be trusted as *the carriers* of discourse. Who&#39;s to say they&#39;re not injecting trojan horses on the code to keep their much worthy &quot;*control*&quot; over everything?

Until an unnamed friend I didn&#39;t know I had opened my eyes in December (by PM&#39;ing me [this link](https://what.thedailywtf.com/t/how-can-this-be-so-wrong-aka-the-discopocalypse-thread/51117/953)), I used to engage and participate a lot in Discourse&#39;s main forum (the meta), trying to do whatever I could to improve the tool I was using more and more. Heck, *I think* (at least could find nothing searching for it right now - hoping they didn&#39;t delete anymore stuff) I may have not even mentioned Ai, basiux or openai there, my recent discovery as *a reason to live*, a topic that&#39;s 24/7 in my mind. I really try to keep things in focus, on topic, not only there, everywhere I go. And so I just wanted to pay it forward / pay it back for such a cost free awesomeness.

But...

[My activity there](https://meta.discourse.org/users/cregox/activity) became almost zero since that past month, precisely due to [that eye opener (those guys **got me**](https://what.thedailywtf.com/t/the-doing-it-wrong-of-the-discojuice-huffing-dude/53070/142?u=cregox) and [I&#39;m lovin&#39; it)](https://what.thedailywtf.com/t/fire-men-confess-your-support-for-hillary-clinton/53993/45?u=cregox).

And then, this **one time** of the very few I go back (to posting on meta) they hit me down with censoring again. It feels like being beaten down hard with a metal bat. &quot;*Community building*&quot; (as they claim) my ass. They don&#39;t give a flying whoopie crap about people. I truly believe they&#39;re not in this for the money, but boy, it&#39;s hard to keep on this faith in their humanity.

Below is the latest thing I&#39;ve posted there (by the time of the original writing here), except the part I&#39;ve lost thanks to their prompt deletion (as discourse admin, you can go to post edit history and delete stuff, by pressing the garbage button, and they did it so fast I never even got my email about my post, which happens in less than 15 minutes usually). In here it&#39;s already included the the last paragraph I ended up adding later, while editing their censoring and trying to make the post go through. At least this time they didn&#39;t delete the whole post and, clearly, they just wanted *that* part off!

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;I actually no longer have the [original post completely wiped by discourse team](https://meta.discourse.org/t/use-of-discourse-for-crowd-sourced-project-evaluation/37805/3?u=cregox) because all the backup stuff I had in place (lazarus, discourse auto email me, copyless - I didn&#39;t copy, etc) things have **failed**. One of them was counting discourse was such a great tool (edit history). **It isn&#39;t**, especially when ill used by their mods (other than the *uncalled bugs*, of course).&lt;/summary&gt;

@Steve_Powell I use discourse for about every thing. From blogging, to backing up internet media, talking with people or making a ticket system for my now dead startup. Only reason I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve tried &quot;anything similar&quot; is because I don&#39;t have a crowd to toy with.

*(part edited out - rewritten from memory)*
&gt; Lately I have been growing less and less fond of discourse (and Jeff). I hope the team can get bigger and faster as by the way things are going I fear they could go down like StackOverflow *did / is doing* IMHO. &lt;small&gt;(... can&#39;t remember a good part of it, but there was not much more ...)&lt;/small&gt; It has been over 2 years since their beta release and I think still up to today, there is nothing that gets technically any close to it. Discourse is that awesome.

Anyway, to me the biggest block for using discourse today is **not so much** the cost for hosting as it is the time required to get a basic setup up and running as you&#39;ve experienced. Although the cost also seem to be much bigger than what could be... At least for pet projects as I&#39;ve being using it.

For any kind of crowd, I&#39;d argue both those &quot;blockages&quot; are quite minor so, yeah, by all means, keep going for it! And share more of what you&#39;ve done! :D

Also...

I think @michaeld (from that discoursehosting service) would like to know about your usage case there! :)
&lt;/details&gt;

Finally, here is Sam&#39;s (Jeff&#39;s right hand) PM to me, along with my obviously unanswered reply, to which I was honestly hoping to get answers:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/w68flg565bkltly/Screenshot%202016-01-12%2013.54.00.png?dl=0

But, from the silence, I know the answer. They are fucking clueless of what they&#39;re doing (in this respect) or why they&#39;re censoring.</description>
