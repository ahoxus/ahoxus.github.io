    <description>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;I&#39;ve been talking back and forth with buffer [for long time now](/talk/t/dont-know-why-i-cant-stop-applying-for-jobs/7661/3?u=cregox). This is our latest iteration.&lt;/summary&gt;

Thanks a lot Dave and Todd! You just gave me some goosebumps!! :D

And you basically &quot;forced&quot; my mind to try this...

A third topic on the same email subject which lost its meaning...

This is for you 2, and whoever is on the awesome buffer team if you will, but not for buffer. And, of course for me - I&#39;d kill to hear some of your feedback.

What do you think about this?

I love the way you&#39;re thinking here! You rock!

Your thoughts and intuition seem pretty much exactly in line with our product team here, we have the late stages of building a new composer which helps manage each separate social channel. This really helps overcome the unique features of each one, such as link previews, character limits, and things like URL source parameters which are needed for Pinterest.

When this is a little closer to being finished I&#39;d love to enable the beta version for you to check out? I have a hunch your feedback would be super valuable on this if you&#39;d be up for it!

Just really want to say how much I appreciate that you would help us out by sharing your experience and time with us, helping us improve, it really blows me away that we have such amazing customers!

Cheers!



Would love to hear how I did?

Here, &quot;I&#39;ve made&quot; a UX for you: Something like this https://www.dropbox.com/s/cn9vhmdo6emqmgs/Screenshot%202015-12-31%2007.44.58.png?dl=0 ;)

Yes, that certainly has everything to do with it!

But look... https://www.dropbox.com/s/math7j6fry5vgw9/Screenshot%202015-12-31%2007.39.36.png?dl=0

There&#39;s a better way to make that interface clearer... Show 1 custom thumbnail for each social media below, with each respective social icon on top. And let us change whichever we want for what we want.

In my case, all I want is that 1 image that do show up to go to all networks the same way.

I understand there are technical challenges behind all this, reason why buffer is so amazing. What I don&#39;t understand is why you can&#39;t figure out ways to overcome those barriers. And if you really can&#39;t, then that interface idea would simply always show an empty square on twitter, in which anyone would &quot;happily&quot; use to add images to twitter if they wanted to. ;)

Thanks so much for following up, Caue!

With Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn, if there&#39;s a link in the post we create a link preview which is what would happen if you posted natively to those sites. With Twitter we can&#39;t quite do that, Twitter doesn&#39;t have link previews the same as the other networks so an image needs to be manually attached. Could that explain the troubles here, or have I got my wires crossed?

Thanks for your patience working this out with me, I&#39;m keen to get everything smoothed out as soon as possible!

Cheers!
Dave

I thought of sending screenshots, but you could&#39;ve just looked at my twitter. Almost everything there should have a photo, and it doesn&#39;t.

I never tried sharing to 1 media only, I&#39;m really not interested in doing that. Is that maybe part of the problem?

Hey there Caue,

Todd here following up for Dave.

Great to hear from you again! So sorry for the trouble here with images on Twitter. Would you possibly be up for sharing with us a screenshot of what you see on your end? I&#39;d love to dig into this a little bit more for you. 

On Twitter, when you share a link you should have the option to select an image to include in the post. Here&#39;s a screen capture of this process: http://cl.ly/3X222K2R1e0o

Let me know what you think, or if this helps at all. Eager to get this working for you 100%!

Warmly,

Todd

Oh, oh... And here&#39;s another idea for the buffer team:

/talk/c/buffer

It&#39;s unfinished, but the idea is there and I reaaaaally want to implement it.

Force your customers to create CATEGORIES, teach them why and how.

Add a #tag for each post, with the category.

Viewers / subscribers can now choose which topics to follow from that one person. Creators like me can continue on making content on many different areas!

How LEGENDARY would this be, huh?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C19US6rqqAo

Now, I believe nothing but google plus (thanks to collections) would be able to make any sense of this... What I was thinking was just to use something like a HTML frame on top of every link which would offer a link to buffer (well, this forums in my case) in which people could subscribe **there** for the topics of their interest.

At least while facebook, twitter, linkedin, etc don&#39;t catch up on the tech. :smiley:</description>
