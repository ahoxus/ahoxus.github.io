<p>Your thoughts and intuition seem pretty much exactly in line with our product team here, we have the late stages of building a new composer which helps manage each separate social channel. This really helps overcome the unique features of each one, such as link previews, character limits, and things like URL source parameters which are needed for Pinterest.</p>

<p>When this is a little closer to being finished I'd love to enable the beta version for you to check out? I have a hunch your feedback would be super valuable on this if you'd be up for it!</p>

<p>Just really want to say how much I appreciate that you would help us out by sharing your experience and time with us, helping us improve, it really blows me away that we have such amazing customers!</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Would love to hear how I did?<br>Satisfaction Rating Icons       </p>

<p>P.S. We're so grateful to get the chance to work with you from all over the world! Just hit reply to this email to get back in touch anytime! Oh, and we're super excited about Buffer for Video - itâ€™s included for free in all of our plans. If you'd like to check it out, you can find it here!</p>

<p>But look... <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/math7j6fry5vgw9/Screenshot 2015-12-31 07.39.36.png?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/math7j6fry5vgw9/Screenshot%202015-12-31%2007.39.36.png?dl=0</a></p>

<p>There's a better way to make that interface clearer... Show 1 custom thumbnail for each social media below, with each respective social icon on top. And let us change whichever we want for what we want.</p>

<p>In my case, all I want is that 1 image that do show up to go to all networks the same way.</p>

<p>I understand there are technical challenges behind all this, reason why buffer is so amazing. What I don't understand is why you can't figure out ways to overcome those barriers. And if you really can't, then that interface idea would simply always show an empty square on twitter, in which anyone would "happily" use to add images to twitter if they wanted to. <img src="http://talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=1" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>On Wed, Dec 30, 2015 at 11:32 PM PST, Buffer <a href="mailto:hello@buffer.com">hello@buffer.com</a> wrote:<br>Thanks so much for following up, Caue!</p>

<p>With Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn, if there's a link in the post we create a link preview which is what would happen if you posted natively to those sites. With Twitter we can't quite do that, Twitter doesn't have link previews the same as the other networks so an image needs to be manually attached. Could that explain the troubles here, or have I got my wires crossed?</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience working this out with me, I'm keen to get everything smoothed out as soon as possible!</p>

<p>Cheers!<br>Dave</p>

<p>I never tried sharing to 1 media only, I'm really not interested in doing that. Is that maybe part of the problem?</p>

<p>Todd here following up for Dave.</p>

<p>Great to hear from you again! So sorry for the trouble here with images on Twitter. Would you possibly be up for sharing with us a screenshot of what you see on your end? I'd love to dig into this a little bit more for you. </p>

<p>On Twitter, when you share a link you should have the option to select an image to include in the post. Here's a screen capture of this process: <a href="http://cl.ly/3X222K2R1e0o">http://cl.ly/3X222K2R1e0o</a></p>

<p>Oh, oh... And here's another idea for the buffer team:</p>

<aside class="onebox whitelistedgeneric">
  <header class="source">
    <a href="../../c/buffer.html">
      
      talk.cregox.com
    </a>
  </header>
  <article class="onebox-body">
    

<h3><a href="../../c/buffer.html">buffer</a></h3>

<p></p>

  </article>
  <div style="clear: both"></div>
</aside>


<p>It's unfinished, but the idea is there and I reaaaaally want to implement it.</p>

<p>Force your customers to create CATEGORIES, teach them why and how.</p>

<p>Add a #tag for each post, with the category.</p>

<p>Viewers / subscribers can now choose which topics to follow from that one person. Creators like me can continue on making content on many different areas!</p>

<p>How LEGENDARY would this be, huh?</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="C19US6rqqAo" data-youtube-title="Barney Stinson - Legendary Compilation" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

<p>Now, I believe nothing but google plus (thanks to collections) would be able to make any sense of this... What I was thinking was just to use something like a HTML frame on top of every link which would offer a link to buffer (well, this forums in my case) in which people could subscribe <strong>there</strong> for the topics of their interest.</p>

<p>At least while facebook, twitter, linkedin, etc don't catch up on the tech. <img src="http://talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=1" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
