    <title>Porn and viruses</title>
    <link>/talk/t/porn-and-viruses/7732</link>
    <description>Originally [posted it on HTG but it was &quot;removed&quot;][1] there (at least they don&#39;t [just delete things][2], looks like)... This was a &quot;draft&quot; 26 days ago, I think I&#39;ll never make it to a blog post, but now I rather post it somewhere anyway.

---

I highly suspect this link have a virus:

http://mackeeperapp3.mackeeper.com/landings/123.1/?affid=mzb_206.5278701.1445069574.2.mzb&amp;utm_source=dblpmp&amp;utm_medium=popunder&amp;utm_campaign=mk_dblpmp_ww_chr_jcffra&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_content=&amp;userDefiner=mzb_2330&amp;trt=29_352451156&amp;alert=15&amp;tid_ext=Pornhub


And this does not:

http://mackeeperapp3.mackeeper.com/landings/123.1/

If it does, I also believe the virus is in that URL hacking, and should be visible right there.

Being the lazy progammer* I am, I didn&#39;t bother to verify this, so...

Can anyone else confirm this? :P

Also, if you&#39;d want to know more, there&#39;s an almost completely unrelated spin off subject here, which comes from the origin of this link, in pornhub (thus the only relationship I could find between the 2 topics). It&#39;s one of the very few porn videos I consider educational, highly interesting, very well done and insightful as to bringing questions about sexuality. But still porn, probably made over 5 years ago.

Do [take a look][3]! ;)
