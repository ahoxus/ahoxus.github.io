        <p>cregox talk is a random forum-ish place where we can talk about anything! <em>We shall never delete or moderate a post that isn't considered clear spam.</em></p>

<h1><strong>Who is it for?</strong></h1>

<p>Anyone interested in chaos!</p>

<p>There are 3 commandments of what should be avoided at all costs (never forbidden). These are among the most circular and vicious popular subjects in the world today (and for the longest time):</p>

<p>no religion<br>no politics<br>no possessions <small>(under <a href="../../lets-make-a-podcast/7753.html">review</a> of a better short term for the general idea)</small></p>

<h2><strong>What can you find here?</strong></h2>

<p>A lot of confusing texts, mostly around <a href="../../../c/buffer.html">categories on buffer</a>, probably still such as: tech, science, skepticism, philosophy, entertainment, porn, intelligence and some meta. You know, anything that matters! <img src="https://talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=3" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<h1><strong>Why should you come here?</strong></h1>

<p>Because <a href="../../similar-web-sites-forums/52/1.html">you could not find anywhere else good enough</a>! There are many communities out there, but they're either too restrictive (I ended up finding up that even "the daily wtf" is <a href="https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/21279/unofficial-w-e-tldr-stuff-thread-spoilers-still-needed-nsfw/13">too restrictive to my taste</a>) and/or got a bad forums software.</p>

<p>In fact, if you do know of anywhere else, please let us know! We'd love to go there. Just keep in mind the tool has to be at least as good as <a href="https://nodebb.org/">nodeBB</a>, <a href="http://flarum.org/">flarum</a> or even the one we're still using here, as legacy, <a href="http://discourse.org/">discourse.org</a> (beware <a href="http://blog.cregox.com/2015/12/25/new-blog-platform-once-again.html">Jeff is an ass</a>).</p>

<h1><strong>Where can you read more (links, resources, etc)?</strong></h1>

<p>The <a href="../../a-beginning-for-the-forums-here/77bda.html?u=cawas">forum</a> was born from a fan (<a class="mention" href="../../../users/cregox.html">@cregox</a>) of <a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/">SGU</a> who was too excited about using the most advanced forums tool there was back then and wanted to use it for free expression of anything in their mind.</p>

<h2><strong>Why you talk so much about that discourse thing?</strong></h2>

<p>Think of <a href="http://www.quora.com/">quora</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a>, if you will, but using this open source technology made by the same guys from <a href="http://www.stackexchange.com/">StackOverflow</a>. You'll <em>probably</em> only be able to understand how good this is once you start using it, and once we do have a community to power it up. So, do try out <a href="https://www.discourse.org/faq/customers">some similar sites with bigger communities (these are their paying customers)</a>. But <strong>don't go too far into building a huge community</strong>, or <a href="https://what.thedailywtf.com/t/tdwtf-forum-faq/370">you could easily break the toy</a>.</p>
