    <description>A lot of cregox&#39;s ramblings and somewhat incoherent thoughts very much shaped by the brazilian culture. (There are more posts on the [portuguese category][1]).

Only staff members can create new topics here, about anything. Anyone can talk about it.

Some older topics came earlier, some came later. They&#39;re all from either of the [older blog][2] or the [even older one][3]. *For now* the new ones shall be all originated straight from here. Sorry for the mess, pay attention to the details! ;)

Eventually this may migrate to [a new blog](http://blog.cregox.com) or, *just maybe*, the new space might get merged into here, [using plugins](https://meta.discourse.org/t/sams-blog-plugin/12656?u=cregox) and [a better &quot;discourse tool&quot;](/talk/t/discourse-is-way-too-much-about-censorship/7802).
