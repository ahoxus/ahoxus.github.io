    <description>okay, maybe this is more about &quot;tech / science&quot; than **fun** but the perspective I want to bring here is more about the fun of it! :smile:

yeah, she still reminds me of David Bowie, in this angle.

this is the first time I&#39;m sharing a full [narrative](talk.cregox.com/t/narrative-clip-and-privacy/7699) moment: http://nrv.io/1Ztom6y

[pareidolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia) (i.e. brain malfunction) happens with every single thing. it&#39;s basically our brain not functioning as we&#39;d expect - it&#39;s easy to perceive it as &quot;optical illusion&quot;, but it sure happens with *songs*, *smelling*, *self perception*, *memories*, ***anything***. in my case I think I just don&#39;t pay enough attention to too many facial details for quick pattern recognition.

here&#39;s another fun one for most people:

and [here&#39;s my small messed collection](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q5j580kvytbfwi9/AAA2dY0YSkK9YtQzPawCOU9Da?dl=0) with just a few of them! :)</description>
