How? I can tell you how it won&#39;t be like, but it&#39;d sure be fun if it&#39;s any close: http://b.cregox.com/a-novel

One thing is for certain: humans and humanity will be **completely changed** by it. A bigger evolutional leap than anything that ever happened before.

And it will most certainly happen before 2040, as Ray Kurzweil genius predicts.

I truly cheer for start seeing it within the next 7 years (5 years before a PC can emulate a human brain on its own), but who knows? In science, any prediction with more than 5 years advance is about the same as saying &quot;nobody knows, we can only hope&quot;.</description>
