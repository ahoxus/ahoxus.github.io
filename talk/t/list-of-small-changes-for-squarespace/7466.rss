Hello,


I&#39;m hoping you can help me with some small changes to my squarespace template..


Could you please give me a quote to do the following things on my marquee template site, I would really like to make these changes as soon as possible, ideally by early next week, looking forward to hearing from you:


1) Add code so that I can add my own sidebar to my blog/journal page.


2) Change the colour of the directional scrolling arrow on my homepage to white - at the moment it is black and I can&#39;t change it.


3) Allow me to change the colour of the sign up for newsletter button and type to the same grey as my other buttons/text.


I can give you the log ins for my site so you can have a look but it is not live at the moment.


Looking forward to hearing from you, and hopefully getting this done asap.


Thank you so much!


Emily

              <p>First, do read <a href="http://www.cregox.com/your-home">www.cregox.com/your-home</a></p>

<p>Don't give people logins like that. With squarespace, you can simply
[invite them as contributors](
<a href="http://help.squarespace.com/guides/managing-contributor-permissions">http://help.squarespace.com/guides/managing-contributor-permissions</a>)
<strong>but</strong> for analyzing your squarespace website all I should need is the
URL. It's always open for visitors unless you've specifically disabled the
pages.</p>

<p>Changing colors is usually a matter of a very simple Custom CSS. Even more
often, it's much simpler than that - it's just <a href="http://help.squarespace.com/guides/making-style-changes">changing the template
style</a>.</p>

<p>Having some kind of custom sidebar present in every page on a template that
have none (do keep in mind <a href="http://help.squarespace.com/guides/adding-content-to-a-sidebar">a few squarespace templates have a sidebar
feature</a>)
might become very complicated, as that will deal with responsive design.
But I could do <strong>something nice</strong> there and if you need <em>more</em> later on we
can discuss later development.</p>

<p>In any case, all your 3 items should cost me less than U$ 213 (unless I
need much further research). And I would need a U$91 upfront payment along
with admin access to the website. I can only promise delivery starting
Tuesday 17th if you confirm both my requests 1 week before. I mean, if I
get paid and access before next Wednesday for instance I will deliver it
before Wednesday 18th.</p>

<p>The sooner you're okay to continue, the sooner I can start working on it.
It will depend on my queue list of tasks.</p>

<p>If by any chance I do need a lot of further research, I'll let you know how
much more it might cost (it will be U$21 per hour) and I can refund you
100% in case you don't want to continue. Although this is slightly
unlikely. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink" width="64" height="64"></p>
