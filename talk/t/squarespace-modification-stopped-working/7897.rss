    <description>Hi Caue

Hope you are well.

You did a small Squarespace modification for me about a year ago. It was adding thumbnails to the blog page on my website: http://www.formulate.com.au/blog/.

I’ve just posted another blog entry (“Is inline validation out?”) and the thumbnail is not showing. Can you help me work out what’s wrong?

Many thanks,

Jessica Enders</description>

<p>It may still help you on debugging if you know the error wasn't showing up outside the live blog. When I made a new test blog, there was no such issue there.</p>

              <p>Hi Caue</p>

<p>I appreciate you taking some time to look into this. I don’t appreciate that you published a test blog post live to my site, which then triggered an email to my 200+ subscribers with a link to said test blog post. It’s an embarrassing and surprising mistake.</p>

<p>I think I’ll take it from here, thanks.</p>

              <p>Well, it's clearly something going wrong with the JSON squarespace is generating. I'm not sure, however, what's causing this although it's certainly not the script.</p>

<p>Might be a good idea trying to get in touch with their support.</p>

<p>As you may know, I'm unfortunately not working with this any longer...</p>

<p>But I did take some time to take a look at this. I was surprised to see I still had access to your admin and noticed the blog entry you were talking about is a draft. So I did a quick test and noticed the error. There is something wrong and weird going on indeed. The thumbnail doesn't show and there is a console error which I won't be able to debug right now.</p>

<p>Just want to let you know I'll try again and see what I can do as quickly as possible, but it may take some time. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/frowning.png?v=3" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
