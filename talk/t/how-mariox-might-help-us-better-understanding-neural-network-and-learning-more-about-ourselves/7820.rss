*It&#39;s all about the little details*

&lt;small&gt;I&#39;m finding it hard to categorize some posts... This could fit under [tech](/c/buffer/tech), [fun](/c/buffer/fun) or neither! Maybe we need a new one.&lt;/small&gt;

Basically, there&#39;s a small but quite relevant update on www.basiux.org#details giving hints on what you should pay most attention on Seth&#39;s video. Check it out - **click on _Details_**!

<blockquote><p>For some fresh news...   I've <a href="https://github.com/basiux/basiux.github.io/commit/de06921c82c9957d161922760166f949234266b5" rel="nofollow">just updated</a> the website to add a few important markers on the first video, about Mar I/O video. Then <a href="https://github.com/basiux/basiux.github.io/commit/e2434a33d48eef87609d6242a4221635f22c34df" rel="nofollow">again</a>. And <a href="https://github.com/basiux/basiux.github.io/commit/f581401fc5a7d81c07aba7eacd4f506d2a673868" rel="nofollow">again</a>.   Probably the most important aspect of that video there is being able to view <a href="https://github.com/basiux/basiux.github.io/issues/3" rel="nofollow">the missing Neural Network (due to this open issue)</a>, or at least glimpse at what it could be if we can implement it mostly unchanged. It's also the most important issue to be resolved, <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/basiux-from-neural-networks-to-ai-singularity-the-new-slogan-created-after-a-sharktank-application/7819/1">right now</a>, for Mariox.
