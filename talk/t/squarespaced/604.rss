&lt;p&gt;So, I finally decided to move away from blogger and into &lt;a href=&quot;http://squarespace.com&quot;&gt;squarespace&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, away from wordpress as well (the old site was dreadful), about 2 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t the perfect platform, much to the opposite... Even migrating from blogger wasn&#39;t as &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.squarespace.com/guides/importing-content-from-blogger&quot;&gt;straight forward as squarespace tools lead us to believe&lt;/a&gt;. But I now think it&#39;s the best &lt;strong&gt;cost benefit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard to really customize the layout without injecting code, and there&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://answers.squarespace.com/questions/9349/can-i-backup-my-site&quot;&gt;no true backup&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to move away to another platform, it is limited to exporting an XML to Wordpress, which I haven&#39;t even tested myself. All that&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.squarespace.com/guides/how-is-my-site-data-backed-up&quot;&gt;pretty scary stuff&lt;/a&gt; if you&#39;re used with &quot;&lt;em&gt;freedom&lt;/em&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;em&gt;ownership&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. There&#39;s no FTP for dog&#39;s sake!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also nearly impossible to edit anything on the site if you&#39;re not at your computer (i.e. using a smartphone or tablet). You can post on the blog using emails, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While customer support is super responsive, in my experience half the time it won&#39;t be as technical and as knowledgable as I&#39;d like, and they easily can be misleading. Like everything else around squarespace, it&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s darn good. You just have to learn to use it, and it&#39;s quite a small learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1409611536125_126407&quot;&gt;Now, for the good side...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1409611536125_125707&quot;&gt;U$8 / month with a free domain name (on the yearly plan), great analytics, contributors, image handling, responsive design, worry free updates and security, virtually unlimited traffic handling, and even a somewhat limited (us banks only, thanks to stripe) ecommerce built-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1409611536125_125708&quot;&gt;Those and other little good details on squarespace are so awesome that even the big failures are overlookable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1409611536125_125709&quot;&gt;As for the backup, well, supposedly there&#39;s always &lt;a data-cke-saved-href=&quot;http://www.websitetooltester.com/en/blog/create-a-backup-of-your-website-httrack/&quot; href=&quot;http://www.websitetooltester.com/en/blog/create-a-backup-of-your-website-httrack/&quot;&gt;HTTrack and SiteSucker&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on your site, you may find that&#39;s enough. For me, using Marquee template, it didn&#39;t work so well, but most of the site is backed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yui_3_17_2_1_1409611536125_125710&quot;&gt;All those restrictions are quite understandable. It&#39;s not easy to keep a webserver so smooth and secure if everyone is able to easily inject code.&lt;/p&gt;
