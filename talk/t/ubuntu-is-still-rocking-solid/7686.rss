    <description>(Quick?) Nostalgic post.

It&#39;s been almost 6 years since I used Ubuntu for at least 1 day. Really using it to accomplish anything for myself. Yesterday, that was working a bit on emails and studying.

Today I&#39;ve found [this][1], can&#39;t remember how:

&gt; **things I&#39;m missing in ubuntu**
&gt; this was in my signature since 9.04 and I decided to make a topic out of it and add few items.

&gt; - a (yet) better network manager (nm07 is almost there)
&gt; - a nicier file copier handler (rsync alike)
&gt; - a more compact-looking theme (i want more screen space!)
&gt; - a bigger log/cache for *system monitor* (no geek stuff)
&gt; - &quot;[time machine][2]&quot;

&gt; not much more else, ubuntu is great!

Old. And interesting.

Ubuntu now have a great network manager, but none of the other items! Maybe it has a better log system monitor, I haven&#39;t checked. But I doubt it.

The forums suck bad. They should have updated it at least to Xen Forums, or something. Or at least [I thought so][4] for a little while! :P Another awesome job, ubuntu!!

One of those items keep coming back. **rsync**. I wondered why we still haven&#39;t got this right anywhere, **specially** in Ubuntu where it should be easy to implement. Why not?!
