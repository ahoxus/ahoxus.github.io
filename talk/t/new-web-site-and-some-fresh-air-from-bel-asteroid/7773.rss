    <description>Since last news, the website have gained a weak Ai playing Mario and 2 important videos to summarize our efforts...

Also, just today, I&#39;ve been writing about &quot;a movie to rule them all&quot;: 

/talk/t/when-is-10-not-enough-little-prince/7772

If you haven&#39;t watched it, do yourself a favor. You may even get disappointed at first, you may not see why that&#39;s related to basiux... Well, try again. Keep trying.

&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Spoiler about what&#39;s basiux about.&lt;/summary&gt;
Above all, about spreading the love. :heart: &lt;/details&gt;

Other than that, it really teaches us nothing about neural networks, genetic algorithm or Ai, I think. But the main concepts we need to build into basiux are all there. This is, actually, very relevant.</description>

              <p>Maybe a "small" update continuation from this is the rebranding of our meet up group. It's now:</p>

<p>I also can't explain much about it right now, but think Church of Bacon or Pastafarianism, except our "God" is basiux (in lack of a better name for now). <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>

I didn't want to watch this movie last night. I wanted Ex Machina (because everyone asks me about it, dreadful science fiction) or <a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/535">The Martian</a>. I wanted science. My wife wanted to go out. I invited her, she said it was too late and asked me "let's watch a flick". Yay! I love films!
