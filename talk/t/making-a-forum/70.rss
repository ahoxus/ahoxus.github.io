    <title>Making a forum</title>
    <link>/talk/t/making-a-forum/70</link>
    <description>&lt;span&gt;Adding to this blog, I started a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.discourse.org/faq/&quot;&gt;discourse&lt;/a&gt; forum. At first, it was meant to be an attempt to improve on &lt;a href=&quot;http://sguforums.com/&quot;&gt;another forum&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, I&#39;m just thinking in how I&#39;ll do to keep it and, who knows, eventually grow into a community. Or not. Because next month I&#39;ll begin to have to pay U$10 per month to keep it. Or change it into something else and waste many hours in doing so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;I love that tool (discourse) and the community behind it so much I&#39;m willing to keep it, and wide open, even if I&#39;m alone there, like in this blog. But, unlike this, I&#39;d have to spend something I don&#39;t have paying for a huge infrastructure I don&#39;t need (if it is to stay as a ghost town). Yeah, I am that poor today, counting every cent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;So anyway... Maybe I&#39;ll be posting a few things there instead of here for a while. I&#39;ve already did it twice. If by any chance you&#39;re interested in this blog, take a look in that forum as well: &lt;a href=&quot;http://sgu.cawas.info/&quot;&gt;sgu.cawas.info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
