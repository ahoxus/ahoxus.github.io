    <title>Making of IMRS - a great sex film led me to finally move my ass into making a raw version of &quot;the advisor&quot;</title>

&lt;small&gt;This was hard to summarize in such a small space, but it&#39;s also not that big of a buffer. I would normally add this to [fun](/c/buffer/fun) but, being an RFC, I guess tech suits better.&lt;/small&gt;

No photos in this post (as I try to always do in buffer) because the link has it all and this is a lot of reading material.

The links with deeper explanations are all there, including for &quot;the advisor&quot;, on the right side. The explanation is also there, on the Disclaimer. So, I guess the only thing left to say is: **could** you **please _read it all_** and then **comment**? :smile:</description>

Movies are all about storytelling. 

Disclaimer about The Rating Scale

Maybe <a href="/talk/t/from-wildcard-through-computers-to-the-unknown/7636?u=cregox">the first manifestation</a> of that wish happened almost 1 year ago. Something like <a href="http://slant.co">slant.co</a> but maybe even simpler and even better. 

After (re)watching [Strictly Sexual] yesterday, finding it a 10, and having to re-scale it from 7, I've decided to finally starting doâ€¦
