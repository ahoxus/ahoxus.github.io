*some traditional &quot;art&quot; I&#39;ve made as a kid, using a mouse and a magazine to copy it from.*

this post has probably nothing to do with Peter Spidey there.

nowadays I&#39;m better defining who I am, what I do, and what I&#39;ll be doing. my position in society. and just starting to use many variations of this sentence:

&gt; I&#39;m an A.S.I. enthusiast, researcher, artist and progammer since 90&#39;s - www.cregox.com

I think it defines me very well, too bad it&#39;s so long. I believe there&#39;s no single word for it, yet. and so I came up with a temporary name for my quest into that:

www.basiux.com

to facilitate, at very least, my inner dialog. ( on a side note, looks like I keep getting back to that X... anyway... )

eventually that quest led me into this new word.

reason I&#39;m not a regular programmer is I never really wanted to be one. it&#39;s just if you play with computers for long enough, you&#39;ll end up learning some scripting. if you&#39;re committed to technology and surrounded by nobody else who is willing to get their hands dirty, you&#39;ll end up programming. that&#39;s what happened to me. I even made a small career out of it. all without purpose, without a goal.

so, I&#39;m actually a **progammer**.

and what&#39;s that &quot;**gammer**&quot;? since it&#39;s a new word I suppose I&#39;m inventing, I&#39;m also defining it as a person who knows how to code, who likes games, dislike grammar, enjoys creativity, skepticism and high tech above all. in other words, as myself! :P

just like there is art in programming it&#39;s as well in inventing new words. or etc.

and if you do identify with this and don&#39;t know how to code (yet), you could call yourself simply a **gammer**. or not. :)</description>

<p>nowadays I'm better defining who I am, what I do, and what I'll be doing. my position in society. and just starting to use many variations of this sentence:</p>

<blockquote><p>I'm an A.S.I. enthusiast, researcher, artist and progammer since 90's - <a href="http://www.cregox.com">www.cregox.com</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I think it defines me very well, too bad it's so long. I believe there's no single word for it, yet. and so I came up with a temporary name for my quest into that:</p>

<p>so, I'm actually a <strong>progammer</strong>.</p>

<p>and what's that "<strong>gammer</strong>"? since it's a new word I suppose I'm inventing, I'm also defining it as a person who knows how to code, who likes games, dislike grammar, enjoys creativity, skepticism and high tech above all. in other words, as myself! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue" width="64" height="64"></p>

<p>just like there is art in programming it's as well in inventing new words. or etc.</p>

<p>and if you do identify with this and don't know how to code (yet), you could call yourself simply a <strong>gammer</strong>. or not. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile" width="64" height="64"></p>
