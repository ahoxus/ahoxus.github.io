    <description>Enquiry

[quote=&quot;jamesaeddleston@hotmail.com&quot;]
Hi there

I&#39;m looking for a Squarespace expert to help update and upgrade my current site: http://www.storiesagency.com/ &lt;http://www.storiesagency.com/&gt;

I have an existing site which has been a bit of a holding site, but I have a new brand design (which is based on the existing one just with new logo and colours) and I&#39;d like to improve the UX and functionality of my site to feel more professional and modern like this one which I like: http://www.bakeryinteractive.com &lt;http://www.bakeryinteractive.com/&gt;

Please let me know if you feel this is feasible and rough budgets.

Thanks

James

              <p>For the rough budgets, please do read <a href="http://www.cregox.com/your-home">www.cregox.com/your-home</a></p>

<p>I would love to take on this job, but I'm an engineer not a designer and at first sight I see little difference between yours and the bakery's reference. It looks like you want a design agency there. My own website ( <a href="http://www.cregox.com">www.cregox.com</a> ) only looks a bit professional because I'm using<br>squarespace. And reason why I love it.</p>

<p>Anyway, what I could do, for instance, is helping adding features squarespace lacks, such as background video or animations like this:<br><a href="http://www.magicleap.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.magicleap.com/</a></p>

<p>I could, in fact, also help designing the website if you are willing to move back and forward with me, since I'm no expert there. I can't distinguish a font face from another just by looking, but I can distinguish them by looking at the source code and I can make anything work.</p>

<p>That being said, it will be hard to come with a quote. Just like in any agency, what I suggest, is we work with your budget. And we can start with my lowest one starting at U$213 for this case, and see where we move from there.</p>
