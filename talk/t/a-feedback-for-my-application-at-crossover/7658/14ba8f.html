        <p>I don't blame him.</p>

<p>Writing emails to unknown people is usually a huge time waster. Reason why I bring everything to public.</p>

<p>But I bet he didn't really try understanding what I tried to say and I probably couldn't properly sum it up in short messages, as I should have.</p>

        <p>Well, this is what I wrote him:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the great salary promise, mixed reviews, this email conversation with Mircea and, maybe above all, hard times find employment / starting up my own biz, I'm still giving some thoughts of applying for a job in your company, mr Andy.</p>
<p>Please, do keep reading on <a href="6.html">/talk/t/a-feedback-for-my-application-at-crossover/7658/6</a> <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=1" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, below that, I've attached the full conversation with Mircea... So, maybe it was my fault after all. I haven't realized this before. I'll try again now.</p>

        <p>Maybe I'll try again in a few months, but what troubles me is the lack of feedback of my test. If I don't know what the problem was, it's hard to guess what they want to see after all.
Good luck and keep posting.</p>

        <p>This is what I've sent him now:</p>

<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote>
<p>Sorry Andy, I don't feel like you read my message or understood what I meant to ask you. And it was <strong>my fault</strong>.</p>
<p>It wasn't just a feedback, <strong>I want to work with you</strong> because, well, I kinda need a job (though maybe not so much).</p>
<p>Please, do pay some attention.</p>
<p>Regardless of your answer, I shall apply later on. I do realize I need to go through the application if I want any of the jobs advertised.</p>
<p>But, by reaching to you, I was seeking for collaborating.</p>
<p>Either with my:</p>
<p>- technical expertise, with my "academical" (all self learned) broad experience (from administration, to finances, theater and flight assistant) or;</p>
<p>- current life goal, which can be summed up by:<br>&gt; building the <a href="http://www.basiux.org/">www.basiux.org</a>, the same goal as <a href="http://www.openai.com/">www.openai.com</a> with 2 twists: <strong>I started it when I was born</strong>. And <strong>I've been using all my free time since July</strong> into building what you can see on the website now (along with all links available).</p>
<p>I mean, <strong>I do know a fucking lot technically about Artificial Intelligence</strong>, but not so much academic nor experience. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=1" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<blockquote><p>this one looks like a template.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>As for your lack of feedback, <a class="mention" href="../../../users/paulo_pedroso.html">@Paulo_Pedroso</a>, and as a <strong>thank you</strong> for those words I've quoted there (which led me to re-evaluate my email there)...</p>

<p>I've wrote some of this elsewhere, but can't remember where so I'll write again from memory:</p>

<p>They're trying to make an <em>awesome <strong>certification</strong> exam</em> without charging for it. The financial resources required to do it have to come from somewhere and, the fact they're not allocating money for it from where it should come (the interested candidate) already reveals the company got a lot of administrative issues. On top of it, my friend confirmed that lack of good managing with them.</p>

<p>Regardless of those issues, they're able to pull it off and make a very, very interesting movement in that whole software hiring / freelancing market. I really like a lot of things as I've already pointed and I think they still might have a <strong>huge potential</strong> in their hand, which <strong>might be going to waste</strong>. I've seen it many times in the past, including in the latest company I've worked (for 2 years), <a href="http://www.p3d.com.br/">www.p3d.com.br</a> - I wasn't just a programmer there, but it was still my main role and they would never care or listen to me for anything non software related. I bet if they did they'd still be up.</p>

<p>My friend who has a startup ( <a href="http://www.nelumbu.com.br/">www.nelumbu.com.br</a> ) is already asking me for Financial Advise - regardless of my complete inexperience in the area, 2 years down his startup road because, well, he trusts in my logical brain and calculation capacities.</p>

<p>I am something else, you see... Really nothing from the norm.</p>

<p>Just had <strong>the bad luck</strong> of not accomplishing any 1 single thing big enough for people to notice me. So far... <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=1" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>(look at my online presence, though, and you'll see <strong>something huge</strong>).</p>

<p>Well, once again <a class="mention" href="../../../users/andy_tryba.html">@Andy_Tryba</a> , it feels as if you didn't really read whatever I wrote. For instance, don't know why you quoted my message there - as I've already done that.</p>

        <p>Actually - I've read all your messages as well as many of your blog posts (as part of this string and the others).  I only reposted the response since my email response above was not in response to the message you posted prior to your post (but you did post it later).

        <p>Ah - thanks for the tip!  And I'm happy to chat on Skype if you think the Software Engineering Manager role isn't the right fit and you think you'd be more interested in a Chief Architect position or something else along those lines.  We have a variety of high skill roles that our customers are looking for that you may be a good fit for.  But either way - good luck and feel free to reach out at anytime.  I know we have a lot of improvement areas to make Crossover better - but I'm definitely committed to listening and learning - then quickly implementing.  I'm passionate we can create this new world where location is completely independent to high-end, long term roles...</p>

<blockquote><p>Ah - thanks for the tip!  And I'm happy to chat on Skype if you think the Software Engineering Manager role isn't the right fit and you think you'd be more interested in a Chief Architect position or something else along those lines.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>As I've told you on skype chat <a class="mention" href="../../../users/andy_tryba.html">@Andy_Tryba</a> (and got a bit sad we couldn't talk over voice), I was preparing myself. And just now, while I'm writing this, I can see <em>I had read you way too wrongly</em> - "<strong>Chief Architect position or something (...) along those lines</strong>" as some "<strong>CTO or something</strong>". And, after the brief skype conversation, I've assumed you read my reply there, which you probably didn't. So it was some miscommunication there.</p>

<p>Fuck my arrogance and stupidity.</p>

<p>In any case, I'll continue as if that was the case, for now. You see, I figured I'd have to do an extraordinary application in every single way to prove my point, and now I believe I'm ready to. I'll even share the whole preparation story right here, right now, and then I'll start rushing to apply. I hope you will read and enjoy! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=1" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<h1>What I will do next and asap</h1>

<p>I've already studied 2 different applications. The obvious 30k one up there in the first post and a new one, just yesterday, with a friend. Yes, you heard me right, I'm partially confessing I had someone to apply together with me, so I could see the application process and get prepared to do it.</p>

<p>You see, I'm not saying anything you don't know it's possible.</p>

<h1>My application</h1>

<p>I'll apply to all positions I think I can perform well on the first stages, and I'll only continue on the one I think I can finish until the end.</p>

<p>I also bet you'll be surprised on how much I can accomplish there, if you take a close look. Instead of wasting a whole week to do something good, I can do it in 2 days, you see? Then, you should be able to realize I don't need to do the last time consuming automated test stage. But even if you don't, I'll complete it as soon as possible.</p>

<h1>Wtf?! why?!</h1>

<p>Don't ask <em>why</em>. Ask, <em>how</em>.</p>

<p>What <strong>triggered</strong> me to this <strong>whole</strong> idea was <a href="../../old-internet-they-imply-yet-thats-a-huge-flat-screen-there/7796.html">@Sandra_Cavalheiro liking this boy on top of this goat</a>. I was watching that post when the idea came to me, so I don't know why.</p>

<p>I would continue to go on explaining, but got not enough time right now.</p>

<p>My point is, I guess: I'll get in one way or another! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=1" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <p>Just to contribute to this topic, here's my experience with Crossover:</p>

<p>As many people here mentioned, the application process is composed of many steps, first of them,  a dull, unpractical online test full of brainteasers. After that, I was directed to another process that was the challenge. It required me three days to have the challenge ready, but I took only too. </p>

<p>On a Saturday prior to my starting the whole challenge work, somebody from Crossover called me "just to check when I was intending to start the challenge", but I guess the person on the phone just wanted to make sure I could speak English. </p>

<p>I was supposed to build this prettifier routine, and to provide documentation, UML, a readme.txt file with installation howtos, a video and best practices along with that. So I did it. It took me a lot of my nerves just to figure out how to make a decent proposition out of such a small project that barely reflected the real world. A couple of days after that, I received a notification to carry on with the process, so I was scheduled an interview with a Technical reviewer. </p>

<p>The interviewer was a very very nice person ( and I can't emphasize enough how nice he was ). I had some quirks with my internet connection which he was very understanding. He even mentioned a couple of times during the screening that he had liked a lot my project and that he was "rooting" for me.Now, I wasn't aware that this technical screening interview was about asking a lot more technical questions and evaluating further on my technical knowledge for the job offer. But although I was very nervous and the questions where tricky ones sometimes, </p>

<p>I did manage to pass that phase as well. Up to that point I had spent two entire weeks of both my time and my nerves. The next day I received this automatic email stating that I had passed the entire challenge process, and that I was now part of this "marked" as they called. I received another email stating that somebody from Crossover would call me, it took a couple of days to receive the phone call.</p>

<p>A nice person called me to congratulate me for now being part of the Crossover Market and he asked if I had any questions. I did have and he did answer my questions. He then said that I was now "in for the ball" as he said. Or in other words, I was still subject to evaluation from the hiring manager and it could happen that he refused my resume and never requested my services or even an interview. Well, that didn't happen, the hiring manager requested me an interview which happened a few days ago. </p>

<p>I'm from Southern Brazil, this hiring manager was from Poland. So I got very nervous as I'm not used to dealing with eastern Europeans. I was afraid to say something that he could hold against me, which he totally did.So, again, the job offer was for a Senior Full Stack Developer, which up to that point I had totally nailed it. Although it was a very very stressful process and in my opinion, full of unnecessary challenges that could have been evaluated in a completely different way, I did manage to get approved, and as they like to say, I was then part of their top 1% ( big deal, huh?! ).</p>

<p>Back the the hiring manager. He was a polite person, but very strict to his technicalities, which seemed to be pretty much focused on someone who had a previous experience with this paid library for graph mapping routines, which I didn't have. </p>

<p>He started the interview by stating that he liked a lot the fact that my resume wasn't focused on just one set of technology, as it's still common to find programmers who are still only .NET or Java programmers; in my case I had this whole lot of "tools" ( as he said ), which reinforced the fact that I was a Senior Full Stack Developer. Up to that point I was feeling pretty confident about myself. He then asked if I had a prior experience with this specific paid library, which I didn't. </p>

<p>Confusingly enough he then changed his conversation by stating that I wasn't then a (sic) full fledged Full Stack Dev. He proceeded the interview by asking if I felt comfortable with instead of working with backend routines, working then with front end. He asked me a lot of questions about AngularJS, Javascript and he then asked me a very confusing question, which was: "have you ever programmed an algorithm?".</p>

<p>Now, I got very confused and nervous about that question! I mean, I have been working as a programmer for 15 years already. I'm currently a Software Engineer, with easily verifiable credentials. Not to boast, I have been hired overseas, worked in The USA and Germany as part of a huge team of development, with very advanced tasks that where required from both my overseas jobs, but he was asking me if I was able to program an a.l.g.o.r.i.t.h.m? What in this world did that mean? Was he implying that I was a web designer? Not to bring down the worth of my designer colleagues, but they do have clearly different working routines than a Software Engineer has. I wasn't sure what he meant, </p>

<p>I got so nervous that I do not even remember what I answered to him. Everything I can recall was the confusion I was feeling. After that he ended the interview by stating that he would interview a few other people and he would get back to me should he have an answer, positive or negative. But one can easily tell when he didn't perform well with something. And I knew I was out.Yesterday I got the automatic email stating that I was "unfortunately" out. </p>

<p>The email stated that I was (sic) "still in for the ball" for any other hiring manager that might get interested in my resume. Today, as I got back to the "market" just to check the other "opportunities", I clicked onto this one for Android Developer position, if I'm correct. Which COMPLETELY erased my history of ALREADY having passed the ENTIRE EXTREMELY PAINFUL selection process, and now I must take all the way again all the process, including the stupid brainteasers, 3 days development challenge, screenings, interviews and everything. Just to be able to apply to a LOWER RANK position than the one I was already selected. Now, there's nothing left from my previously approved position in their market, and I'm as good as somebody who had NEVER EVER gone through their stinking evaluation process.If I can be of any help here with whoever might be reading this review. It's a complete waste of time! </p>

<p>Their entire chain is not capable of truly evaluating a professional by their background and by setting real life challenges. It's all about brainteasers and inventing these humongous requisites with nicely adorned job titles just to as easily as pie, dismiss your entire working history and experience just because you do not know about this expensive stinking library. From all the reviews I read here ( and elsewhere ) all the people who failed in their selection process failed in earlier stages than mine. </p>

<p>Should you ever be in my position, that is: not good for this certain job vacancy, but still in the open for any other you might want. It's not worth it! For should you attempt to apply for a different position, not only you will have to go through the ENTIRE ordeal again, as many times you wish to apply for a position, but your entire history will be erased and you are back to nothing again. Complete waste of time, resources, nerves and money. Please, spend them with something that is worth it!Now I'm left with my nerves in pieces. </p>

<p>I'll have to put all my pieces together again, a little wiser yes, but a LOT more exhausted, in order to be able to pass another application process, this time with something - hopefully - that is worth it.</p>

        <p>Thats so cool response! I've laughed so hard after a.l.g.o.r.y.t.h.m .... Well, now my start of the story.<br>I've contacted 2 days ago about being able to pass that process to apply <em>Team Lead Position</em>. <strong>50$</strong> per hour is rather great salary for me, you know. HR said that I shoud be able to guide 4-5 teams at once with my remote skills. That sounds pretty unbelievable because Im already working as Team Lead and its so hard to guide the only team, what can I do with 5 at once? But im strong person and I want to grow. So no problem, lets try. I've googled all day long to check if it is good idea to apply that <em>"marked"</em> and found that blog as well as some responses on glassdoor. I dont beleive glassdoor reviews, 75% of them are paid, im 100% sure. But some of reviews seemed rather ok.<br>By the way, I was told by HR that at Saturday "some high person" will visit my town to have a close look on candidates so Im invited to that party. <strong>Gonna see</strong> whats going on there. I have a bad experience of wasting large amount of time and nervous while applying some other companies that made me to send 3-7 days developing the apps <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/frowning.png?v=2" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> . That time Ill be smarter and wont tear my ass, cz im already tearing my ass going into production this week. But Im gonna try.</p>

        <p>Thanks both for contributing!</p>

<p>I'm still on my own saga to get in.  I've applied to 2 vacancies and got replies only from one of them. Also the $50 per hour probably for same management role but I wasn't ready for a coding test (management role requiring hands on coding is quite unexpected) and although I've failed that part miserably they wanted me to try again within 1 month rather than the default 6 (maybe because I delivered everything else, maybe because of my history maybe because it's all a mess, no clue) so I decided to go for other things in life on the meanwhile.</p>

<p>As already stated I still want to get in regardless of staying so I'll update this again once I do.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../../users/claudio_fernando_mac.html">@Claudio_Fernando_Mac</a> man, you should better format your text dude!

<p><a class="mention" href="../../../users/lanqu.html">@Lanqu</a> I've got no clue where you're standing in the process. Did you pass it, are you in the market? If so, congratulations.
