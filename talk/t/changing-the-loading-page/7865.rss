    <description>Hey Caue,

You helped me awhile back with some coding on my site (boyfriendscloset.net).
I was wondering if you would be able to help me with something I&#39;m having
trouble figuring out. I was hoping to have a loading page gif with a custom
image. Something like what Reformation Clothing (
https://www.thereformation.com ) has with the small triangle as the page
loads.

Let me know if you are available and if this would be at all possible, also
how much it would cost!

Thanks

Talk soon,
Chantal B.

<p>Unfortunately, I'm no longer working with web sites or squarespace.</p>

<p>In any case, the only way to make this possible, last time I've checked, would be making it a developer site. Just a small hint for your quest, in case you shall persist. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=2" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
