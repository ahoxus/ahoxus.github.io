              <p>this host will shut down soon, probably before July!</p>

<p><a href="http://explosm.net/comics/1135/"><img src="/talk/uploads/default/original/1X/abd89729faa2d0b45fc8037fe0e711fb8baca471.png" alt='googled for "pull the plug" animated images, found it thanks to link from &lt;a href="http://www.funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/89591/Pull#69470a_159660"&gt;http://www.funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/89591/Pull#69470a_159660&lt;/a&gt; and went for full credit' width="489" height="396"></a><br><small><em>don't freak out!</em></small></p>

<p>I've actually announced this "trend" a while ago <a href="http://blog.cregox.com/medium-new-blog-announcement-eYdVBD2">elsewhere</a>.</p>

<p>got an awesome digital ocean support feedback from an email I wrote them about this situation. basically, they cheered me up, told me to hang in there, <strong>and gave me U$40 of credit</strong> <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=3" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> so I could have enough time to figure out what to do. I decided to go with little to no work...</p>

<p>basically I'll manually <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/print-long-topic-to-pdf-redux-again/44639/45?u=cregox">print</a> some relevant topics and host it somewhere. I'll keep full backups of the whole talk, and it should be easy to bring it back up in the next few years, if anyone wishes to. and until the last day here (see below) I'll try to do some scripting for exporting as much content as possible.</p>

<p>at some point I may want to <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/freezing-discourse-site/23225/2?u=cregox">freeze</a> the whole site and not allow any new posts, just to keep the last backup consistent.</p>

<p>not sure when exactly the plug will be pulled though, it will be for whichever comes first: I finish exporting or the current credit is over. right now I've got $37.40 and a $12 bill per month so current date estimations point to July 6th as the last day.</p>

<p>finally, for further reference, always go to the main domain: <a href="https://cregox.com">https://cregox.com</a> or google. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>wow, this is being a long hiatus!<br>probably it will still stay like <a href="/talk/t/a-s-i-or-job-hunting/7717/2">this</a> for a while. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/cry.png?v=3" title=":cry:" class="emoji" alt=":cry:"> </p>

<p>anyway, back to topic.</p>

<p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls><source src="https://openai-sci-demonstrations.s3.amazonaws.com/site-assets/karpathy/flashgames_6x11.mp4"><a href="https://openai-sci-demonstrations.s3.amazonaws.com/site-assets/karpathy/flashgames_6x11.mp4">https://openai-sci-demonstrations.s3.amazonaws.com/site-assets/karpathy/flashgames_6x11.mp4</a></source></video><br><em>a sample of Universe game environments played by human demonstrators.</em></p>

<p>one day before openai newest release <a href="/talk/t/to-kstanley-can-a-neat-mario-start-up-a-basiux/7914/5?u=cregox">I was officially starting to try getting basiux back up</a>. I saw the news and left it on my "read later" list. then, a few hours after replying to mr Stanley there, I finally got to see what <a href="https://universe.openai.com/">openai universe</a> was all about. and...</p>

<p>yet again, they have a lot of similar aspects from what I want to do / see being done. it surprised me, as I wasn't expecting they would continue on going through such a related route at all. plus, the work there is <strong>amazing</strong>!</p>

<p>still, and yet again (again), it doesn't come without its flaws, at least the way I see.</p>

<p>the main issue might also be their biggest win: it's not easy enough to contribute. you do need to install docker, universe and at least toy with python to get in the boat. of course this easily can prove to be beneficial for their goals or even for basiux as a whole, but I'm pretty positive this is a bad choice for bringing it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>making it so generic and, at the same time, focusing on game learning, doesn't rub me in a good way as well. it's a great plan for helping us in figuring out better algorithms, which we still need to do. but not so much for improving a good algorithm or making it grow in the most beneficial way. for all we currently know today, we might already have good enough algorithms and they'd just be lacking a proper tweak along with combined hardware power. if we limit its inputs to keyboard and pixels from games, probably no algorithm today would have enough resources to raise up as a basiux.</p>

<p>and what does all this means to us?</p>

<p>I guess not much.</p>

<p>we still gotta build something to showcase basiux's value. maybe it can now incorporate this universe, maybe it can't, doesn't really matter. if we can't easily use it, it'll probably be better to stick with the plan for now: make a hyper neat mariox so anyone can play with it and effortlessly "share Ai benchmarks for transfer learning" (as they put it).</p>

<p>in another hand, if you want to better understand basiux current efforts, well, now we can simply say:</p>

<blockquote><p>we want to build a kind of openai universe for any user, focused on making it fun and social</p></blockquote>

<p>controversially, if this helps us explaining our plan, in itself is already quite a lot! (in opposite to "not much")</p>

<p>also, maybe <a href="http://discuss.openai.com/">their forums</a> (also using discourse - regardless of <a href="http://blog.cregox.com/2015/12/25/new-blog-platform-once-again.html">how "terrible"</a> it is, <a href="/talk/t/welcome-to-cregox-talk/6/1">we're still using it</a> too) can bring us much value as well.</p>

<p>as for the <a href="/talk/t/true-randomness-app-why-it-could-help-winning-the-lottery-and-building-up-the-basiux/7845?u=cregox">latest plan about randomness</a>, well, it's obviously too bold of a bet for this stage. hopefully later, supposing it eventually pins out. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p><small>ps: read <a href="/talk/t/yeah-im-also-a-progammer/7676">this manifesto</a> if you're wondering what happened with my grammar.</small></p>

<hr>

<p>I'm Caue,<br>a progammer informarticist born in '81 who loves boomerangs and is a college drop out struggling a lot to live by, for over 1 year in portugal now, while trying to learn more about top notch Ai research. coincidentally since I moved here I've been wanting to help developing a Benevolent Artificial Super Intelligence User eXperience. ish. on my very small free time.</p>

<p>here's the NEAT implementation I'm using, which I ported to javascript: <a href="http://basiux.org/#mariox">basiux.org/#mariox</a> (I now realize I'll need to actually implement HyperNEAT there)</p>

<p>I <em>probably</em> still got a long way before better understanding it and being able to tweak it at my will or create something out of it. but <em>then again</em>, some people thought (and I kinda believed them) I couldn't do mariox in even 1 year and it took me mostly surprising less than 1 week (because it was "just" about porting it, thanks to Seth). a very inspired and dedicated one (it eventually led me to many life issues, reason why only now, 1 year later, I'm continuing with this project - but those are points to another topic).</p>

<p>and I find it particularly intriguing how nobody could come up with a generic Ai algorithm capable of giving birth to super Ai. and, in all my ignorance, I find NEAT to come the closest to it. funny enough, I luckily found on reddit (which you should have linked on your <a href="https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html">NEAT main page</a>) that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3xqcrk/im_ken_stanley_artificial_intelligence_professor/cy6zlns/">you believe</a> we're very far away from that.</p>

<hr>

<p>anyway,<br>got you a few questions <small>(I actually had other questions in mind before I thought of adding a song background, trying to google for your taste and stumbling upon that reddit, in which you already answered them)</small>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>why exactly do you think we're so far from the singularity? looks like most people deeply researching and working with the top notch algorithms always think that. from my point of view, of someone who worked mostly solo with programming for the past 20 years, I can easily see many ways it could already have happened any time since around the beginning of this century.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe one of the key overlooked aspects of Ai development is randomness and the lack of using better generators for feeding it creativity. now that's a very far stretched gut feeling, and reason why I ask you, since NEAT relies so much on random data: have you, or do you know of any Ai research actually using true random numbers in large scale and maybe even comparing results with pseudo random?</p></li>
<li><p>could you kindly point me to more people to who I could connect and talk about those topics?</p></li>
</ul>

<p><small>PS for ken: bugs report -&gt; <a href="http://www.aigameresearch.org/portfolio-item/infinite-tower-defense/">http://www.aigameresearch.org/portfolio-item/infinite-tower-defense/</a> is basically broken and so is <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/petalzgame/">petalz</a>. :(</small></p>

<p><small>PS for readers: I can't recommend enough <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3xqcrk/im_ken_stanley_artificial_intelligence_professor/cy7ce3c/">his reddit talk</a> if you want to know more about NEAT and <a href="http://www.santaferadiocafe.org/science/2015/03/24/ken-stanley/">his radio talk</a> about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Greatness-Cannot-Planned-Objective/dp/3319155237">his book</a> if you think tracing objectives is something really important.</small></p>

              <p>Hello,</p>

<p>My wife and I running a wedding videography company and are in the process of building our website on Squarespace and we've ran into a little snag.  We would like to have a gallery to display our videos, which are hosted on Vimeo, but don't like the options for video galleries that they offer.  What I would like to do is start with a blank page and add photos our our couples to it so that we can size them and arrange them however we would like, instead of sticking to the confines of the gallery.  I've attached an image to give you and idea of what I am thinking.  When a picture is clicked on, I would like the corresponding video to open up in a lightbox covering most of the screen.  I've tried to accomplish this using some of the code you have out there for doing the same idea with buttons, but haven't been able to get it to work properly.</p>

<p>Are you available to hire to come up with a solution, or if you already have one would you mind leading me in the right direction?</p>

<p>It is true we have no liberty to be whatever we want to be if we know we're being watched because we do act differently under new realizations of the present.</p>

<p>But the same could be said in a world where there was no privacy ever and suddenly we'd know we're not being watched. Can you imagine it? It's not that hard to imagine. Take someone who believed there's a God watching and suddenly that person became atheist. Nobody is watching. We will act differently... But was the liberty taken away or given?</p>

<p>There's no relationship that can be proved between privacy / lack of it with liberty. It's all a subjective construction in our minds. And it is constructed in a lot of people minds, I'd bet that probably in most of us, including myself as a product of my own culture, even on times I'd like to deny it.</p>

<p>The right to liberty isn't the same as right to privacy, those are terrible grounds to be in. That's not to say we shouldn't have both rights - after all if you have the liberty to choose you should be able to choose privacy for you. But I argue the first, and maybe only right that should be enforced is precisely that freedom of choice. And if you choose no privacy for you, that's up to you.</p>

<p>Or is it? Maybe there's a fallacy here...</p>

              <h1>first, some nonsense rambling / making of this post</h1>

<p><small>It have been a long time since I've posted anything anywhere. Now I need to start moving again... In many different senses. I've started writing this mostly as a rant, almost exactly 168 hours ago (1 week). Now I decided to edit it and include the idea I really want to share (improv everywhere). Take a look at the <a href="https://discourse-meta.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/original/3X/e/9/e9ab87491b3d74473ec1e029b8e4b817b3d8c358.png" rel="nofollow">edit history</a> if you want to read more! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=2" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></small></p>

<p>For one, I must kill most of my past online presence. No, I won't erase anything, hopefully, but some data might be lost in the process. I won't be able to keep this discourse forum for much longer, mostly because I find it idiotic how there's so much care for versioning and, yet, so much censorship, so I need to migrate to a better tool. And I won't be able to keep squarespace for basically the same reason: lack of properly saving data in a transparent way. So I need to move away from both. It is still same core reason <a href="/talk/t/time-to-focus-on-versioning/5601">why I've moved the blog (from sqsp to dsc)</a>.</p>

<p>Just a little while ago I was innocently <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2639915/why-the-mutable-default-argument-fix-syntax-is-so-ugly-asks-python-newbie/2639996?noredirect=1#comment63165843_2639996" rel="nofollow">talking on stackoverflow through comments</a> and they wiped a comment of mine, 3 times, probably because it contained <em>fucking</em>, <em>bullshit</em> and/or <em>censoring</em>, or maybe because I said I <em>hate</em> someone. It was something along these lines: I now officially hate Jeff Atwood from the bottom of my heart, along with all his work. I'm fucking tired of this censoring bullshit - hope I get a good content reviewer human this time (4th attempt), like on the first one (actually 0th attempt). I've been working as moderator in an online tool which most people think is all done by bots... Well, thing is it's still cheaper and better to hire people for that. And we make, ideally, 1% of mistakes.</p>

<p>As if those 2 movements alone weren't enough, I also probably need to stop writing shitty posts like this and find some better way to communicate. I guess this is just some reminiscent will. Nobody cares about my ramblings, why should I continue posting them publicly? Or maybe it will all make sense later on, for my own sake... After all, this might be just me talking to myself and fuck the rest. Still, this could be too cryptic yet again even for my future self. It wouldn't be the first time.</p>

<p>And eventually I need to start working full time with something...</p>

<p>Well, i might be the case I finally had an idea of what that might be!</p>

<h1>how ai+mprove anywhere is being born</h1>

<p>this is an idea I just had while waking up in the middle of sleep. it kinda came from brainstorming another initial idea with myself and it may have been inspired by <a href="/talk/t/father-religion-society-and-science/7471?u=cregox">my annoying dad</a>'s own idea of just  getting a camera and doing whatever with it. he actually wanted me to try doing improv comedy on the streets without any scripting, and he got so hyped by himself he wanted to do it on his end (luckily he lives in another country than I for the past year) if only I would tell him I want him to do it. well, bad parents aside...</p>

<p>what woke me up was thinking on how I could invite someone to take a weekend, record for 1 or 2 hours something live streaming (someone needs to be the cameraman since I have no drones) and try to somehow communicate with the audience - gather their suggestions in a "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGLnFjJelBM" rel="nofollow">whose line is it anyway</a>" style, or something. I'm writing the ideas in order here...</p>

<p>then I started to picture how it could go wrong. well, first microphones. it's the hardest technical part for me, as I've got zero experience with good ones, and best mic I've got is my headset, which can't be used for livestreaming into a cell phone camera dude. so, old speechless style came to mind. and, in time, <a href="http://improveverywhere.com/faq/improv-everywhere-live/" rel="nofollow">improv everywhere</a>.</p>

<p>finally I started to think how to make it happen. thing is, if we plan too much we never really do it. I think I've got enough to start talking with people for trying to improve this idea itself into something we can do. right now my plan is asking everyone who wants to participate, specially at my current job, since starting next month my weekends will take turns and also because there's a good chance I'll find at least 1 person interested there.</p>

<p>hopefully it will be always themed with Ai in mind... my experience with doing amateur-professional theater once tells me that's probably not possible, but now I'll try much harder to always inject a little something into the script. yes, since my first idea I wanted to use at least 8x times more than filming into scripting and planning.</p>

<p>so, are you in Lisbon? do you want to take part of this? <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>another idea I had was making it live in many places, but let's take one step per time.</p>

<p><small>(time to review, clean up and add links)</small></p>

<p>Disclaimer: following there is a sequence of apparently disconnected paragraphs... I hope I can look some other day back and this and connect them with some more sense than what I could today! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=1" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Almost 1 month ago something happened to my brain. I could have died at least twice. I'm now taking some psychiatric medicine trying to regulate it, ground down my thoughts. This whole "I'm truly crazy" universe is brand new to me and I don't know how to properly play in it.</p>

<p>My ideas about Ai are slowly turning into ideas about <a href="/talk/t/how-making-an-app-to-win-the-lottery-and-building-up-the-super-ai-are-related-enter-true-randomness-o-o/7846">randomness</a> and how they need to play together. It's the breath of life missing in Ai. Saying this is about as crazy as talking about the philosopher's stone or a holy grail.</p>

<p>What's even more crazy is realizing all the great ideas in history always came as waves which people captured around the globe way before we could communicate without pigeons. Wait, that's not the crazy part, that's just a fact. What if those ideas were brought up like this because someone had them and the instant you have a great idea it propagates as some kind of energy through the universe and anyone, including your own self who wanted it in your head at first, can capture them?</p>

<p>The lake ness monster is for sure just a urban legend. Today. I brought it up first because it rhymed but then it's easy to make connections with random things that are apparently not connected. You see, the craziness about "magic" and "energy" here lies in things that can not be proved by science - our greatest source of power today. It's from science that we can make truly magical things such as the internet, smartphones, microwaves, elevators... Technologies that can realise unimaginable things to whoever lived before them (except for the few visionaries such as Asimov).</p>

<p>What if the monster was true until science proved it wasn't? What if we could bend time and space with our imagination? Can't we even prove that already? We use technology to prove how far our mind can travel with movies. And it's much farther than the so called "reality", which is nothing more than a plan of existence in which we agree.</p>

<p>How would the universe be if there was only 2 homo sapiens in it? Most atheists would undoubtedly agree: "nothing would be different, except they would probably die thanks to the growing global warming or, if you mean before written history then there would be no global warming".</p>

<p>The crazy thought I wanted to bring here is this: it's all about the story. Narrative wise, we are certainly the most evolved intelligent thing in this universe until we make/find (no difference in a narrative) something bigger - in other words, we are alone so far. And the lake ness did had a monster until we destroyed it.</p>

<p>Why does it matter?</p>

<p>Quantum physics is one way to look at it. Most people believe the invisibly tiny particles is what builds our universe, overall. And they only exist once we look at them. The cat is not dead or alive. The tree didn't fall on the woods if there was nobody to listen. Since almost everyone believe in the science of physics, looks like we're just waiting for the next Einstein to jump in and confirm: yes, God does play dice, not only does she love randomness but she also exists in each one of us.</p>

<p>What you think and what you do with your life matters the world to each one of us. Even if we're all just a grain of sand, we're not the same sand without every grain of it, working in harmony.</p>

<p>scientifically I'd say you could think of Ai with 3 axis: <em>logic</em>, <em>philosophy</em> and <em>arts</em>.</p>
<p><em>(if this answer gets enough interest I'll expand more)</em></p>
<p><strong>logic</strong><br>that's the binary world, the same one that constructs math and progamming*. you can't have any kind of intelligence without a solid logic.</p>
<p><strong>philosophy</strong><br>this is the spiritual world, looked upon mostly through logic (i.e. with much intelligence).</p>
<p><strong>arts</strong><br>materialization. Ai is a lot about ideas but nothing of that matters if you can't bring it to the real world. making a spam filter out of pure logic is an awesome piece art and, make no mistake, programming is a form of art! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=1" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>---</p>
<p>there really is nothing in your life you can't use to learn about researching for Ai, specially if you're talking about the tech singularity. <strong>anything works</strong>.</p>
<p>now, if all you want is weak Ai, the one being sold today, you can leave <strong>philosophy</strong> behind and focus most your efforts in <strong>logic</strong> and, if you're lucky enough, make tons of money with it, with a good enough <strong>art</strong>. just keep in mind money isn't everything - it's just 1/3 of it.</p>

<p>if you know me you should be able to guess it properly as <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-do-I-need-to-learn-in-order-to-research-artificial-intelligence/answer/Caue-Rego">the right answer is one filled with 3 elements</a>: <strong>logic + art + philosophy</strong>.</p>

<p>( still unsure of what's the best category for buffering this... since it's on "help", the request is: come join us! )</p>

<p>now, continuing the discussion from <a href="/talk/t/starting-a-pod-with-this-making-of-cregox-cast/7843/2">Starting a pod with this making of "cregox cast"</a>:</p>

<h1>read my mind</h1>

<p>rules are simple. host brings up a topic, then write down something about it that other players will have to guess. each player will have a few minutes to give it a shot after a presentation and then the answer will be revealed. so it's basically a riddle in which each player takes turn to take a guess.</p>

<p>it will happen near the cast ending because we're not sure everyone will be online near the beginning. I'll always bring a subject for this game, so we'll talk <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passage_(video_game)">about</a> <a href="http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/passage/">PASSAGE</a> (play it at least twice, <a href="http://passage.toolness.org/">online</a> if you prefer).</p>

<p>be our guest to bring up a subject for other players trying to read what's in your mind! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=1" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<h2>schedule and plans for the future</h2>

<p>as the first cast, this one will happen on a Saturday (<strong>today</strong>) at 22:00 UTC, which means I'll start broadcasting in about 5 hours. all the next ones, in case this one also brings a good result, might get moved to Sundays, at 20 UTC.</p>

<p>let's do this!</p>

<br><em>to me, this image is truly <a href="/talk/search?q=random">random</a> for this topic context</em></p>

<p>This is my little "theory" taken right off my butt. Play with it if you want, I'll sure write an app for this in case nobody wants to take on the challenge... And I bet you it will be better than anything you see on the market, including <a href="https://www.random.org/analysis/">Random.org</a> (guess which image below is the true random one).</p>

<p><a href="/talk/t/differences-between-free-will-randomness-and-or-determinism/7804">The universe is deterministic</a> and if we could have the exact variables at the big bang plus enough computational power, we could simulate ours very easily. That may never happen though, since "enough computational power" is probably not possible for computers are inside the universe. It's almost like trying to create a perpetual energy machine - that energy has to come from somewhere. Nothing we know in science points to such a possibility so no such machine that's claimed to be "scientific" is true. "<strong>Impossible</strong>" is a thing, "impossible" certainly exists, specially when we look in retrospect: before airplanes it was indeed impossible to fly at such speeds.</p>

<p>But...</p>

<p>That doesn't mean we can't build models around those initial variables to reach approximate states with much less computer power. Much, much less. We can, today, compress text, image and even videos (i.e. anything meaningful to us) to less than 9% of its original size, very easily.</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="9rIy0xY99a0" data-youtube-title="What is Random?" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

<p>Randomness is what makes data meaningful. Given a data point is not too <a href="/talk/t/quick-random-thought-about-wtf-contact-requests/7646">random</a> we simply call it pattern instead. That is, meaningful data we can recognize.</p>

<p>Now let's talk a bit more crazy. The universe is connected. Coincidences can be very meaningful. When they happen at the same time, even more. Thanks to that, any random data point from previous lotteries that happened right on the same exact time of lottery balls dropping are much more meaningful than any other random data set you can get, to build statistical models.</p>

<p>Finally, that history of previous lotteries data points is not more important than any other history of any other big event happening... Enter <a href="/talk/t/random-what-now/48">true randomness</a>.</p>

<p>Random.org grabs atmospherical data to randomize numbers on an otherwise digital world unable to generate unrecognizable patterns. So, all we need to do to have such thing in the palm of our hands is grab noise from the environment. And yes, it can be just as good as rolling the dice or whatever other random tool from the physical world because we're bringing in physical data into the computah!!</p>

<p>Yeah baby.</p>

<p>So... As for the app...</p>

<p>Use the microphone, the camera, the antenna, the clock, wifi signals, compass, everything to "randomize" the numbers!</p>

<p>And remember to make a good app <a href="/talk/t/checklist-for-a-good-enough-android-podcast-player-like-apples/7096">checklist</a>, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>big numbers</li>
<li>simple interface, bring in everything in one screen</li>
<li>swipe left or right to change results from dice, to coins, lottery, whatever</li>
<li>keep it under 1mb at most (ideally 100kb), or make it using unity3d at once</li>
<li>keep history</li>
<li>offline and online backup (for history)</li>
<li>no ads, no revenue other than in app sales for coin skins or whatever perfume</li>
<li><em>(more to come)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, this could help the basiux because this kind of true randomness can be used for much more meaningful genetic evolution, in case it does pinout as being better over a high enough amount of iterations. It will be impossible for me to test this alone, though.</p>

<p><strong>keep</strong> is, imho, extremely superior to <strong>evernote</strong> for a single reason: it just works. everywhere and fast. no installation even needed.</p>

<p>both have a huge problem: no automated local backups. not even with ifttt or whatever. both can recover from a time machine backup, but it's not all that reliable and it wouldn't really survive the product being pulling off. they both <em>think</em> they'll exist forever and the web is at least 99.999%.</p>

<p>keep probably don't work offline as good as evernote as well, and the elephant has an awesome OCR. but keep have notes colors, an awesome grid view, easy to take simple or complex notes and blazing fast to search them, etc. you know, it's a google product.</p>

<p>google's have a bigger problem: it's <strong>google</strong>. <a href="https://gigaom.com/2013/03/20/sorry-google-you-can-keep-it-to-yourself/">who knows what's going to be the next reader shut down</a>?</p>

<p>the simple solution would be making independent teams within google, who could easily be their own company if google feels the need to pull the plug. also people can follow products by the people, which is what should matter most. sorry apple, jobs less apple is another company. and it will "die", at very least, like ibm and microsoft did.</p>

<p>the ideal candidate to win over both? <strong>github</strong>. but it's not there yet, as well... funny enough, for GitHub I'm only missing a simple unified gui experience in every single platform, which is much easier to overcome than any other problem from the concurrents.</p>

<p>to join in while it's happening, <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/call/s2kz6ex26zejfd6o7fwodxr2pya">click here</a>.</p>

<p>it's like <a href="http://9to5google.com/2016/02/04/hangouts-improved-peer-to-peer/">hangouts have just improved</a> for making this startup even better! and boy, I've been making lots of making ofs lately. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=1" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>so the cast will have no theme whatsoever. the first episode however, should be a hangout around:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ai, basiux and <a>play escape</a> (which will happen in Lisbon 1 week from tomorrow)</li>
<li>more topics?</li>
<li>hopefuly finish up with a game like science or fiction?</li>
</ul>

<p>recording will be public and start in about 11 hours from now at <a href="http://timezone.io/team/cregoxcast">22:00 UTC 0</a> (<a href="http://timezone.io/join/7897e7597505796a">add yourself</a>). preparations begin now.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/admin.r99">@admin.r99</a> will be a guest and <code>everyone</code> is welcomed to join in.</p>

<p>when I join in around minute 11 everything slows down for a while, I was already sleepy and trying to figure out why it was so slow, and it was obviously thanks to my terrible non-fiber 0.5 mbps upstream internet here at historical lisbon center. <strong>I promise the broadcast gets better</strong> later on, if you enjoy artificial intelligence, science and / or philosophy.</p>

<p>topics touched:</p>

<ul>
<li>autonomous cars and tesla ( <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/models">https://www.teslamotors.com/models</a> )</li>
<li>tesla and elon musk ( <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/models">https://www.teslamotors.com/models</a> )</li>
<li>academia Ai</li>
<li>net neutrality</li>
<li>golf bot and tiger woods</li>
<li>chicken or the egg ( <a href="http://www.basiux.org/#mariox">www.basiux.org/#mariox</a> )</li>
<li>reinforced mixed learning</li>
<li>bitcoins</li>
<li>universe determinism</li>
</ul>

<p>I participate in those since the first one (but unfortunately not in all of them) and I think anyone can join. this is the first one I'm aware that's being broadcast, but just near the ending. <code>Moe</code> does a great job <a href="http://timezone.io/team/codenewbieai">organizing</a> 'em and putting things together, along with <a href="https://codenewbie.slack.com/archives/ai/p1454713220000253">the slack channel</a>.</p>

<p>now, this is just in: <a href="https://codenewbie.slack.com/archives/basiux">that hangout may</a> soon become <a href="/talk/t/lets-make-a-podcast/7753">the podcast</a>!!</p>

<p>How? I can tell you how it won't be like, but it'd sure be fun if it's any close: <a href="http://b.cregox.com/a-novel">http://b.cregox.com/a-novel</a></p>

<p>One thing is for certain: humans and humanity will be <strong>completely changed</strong> by it. A bigger evolutional leap than anything that ever happened before.</p>

<p>And it will most certainly happen before 2040, as Ray Kurzweil genius predicts.</p>

<p>I truly cheer for start seeing it within the next 7 years (5 years before a PC can emulate a human brain on its own), but who knows? In science, any prediction with more than 5 years advance is about the same as saying "nobody knows, we can only hope".</p>

<p>still need to merge the ai-poca-lips universe into a story for the first event (which shall be repeated until people ask for a new one) and make a better page explaining what it's all about and how it's still an experiment... but other than that, come in join us at lx (lisbon)!</p>

<p>This is just a quote to this link for my answer on quora: <a href="http://qr.ae/ROw3G7">http://qr.ae/ROw3G7</a></p>

<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote>
<p>In short: it's already helping. Everyone. When you google for something, there's a huge big data Ai in place to give you the best answers. Try Siri and you'll have a glimpse of what Ai can do, and that's still a very weak Ai.</p>
<p>Do you need more than getting answers to any important question almost instantly? Well, the best games out there use heavy Ai - the biggest e-sport game in DOTA style is also one with the most advanced Ai systems in place. How that helps? It helps easing up our mind from the craziness around. A mindfulness technique.</p>
<p>And, yet, all is using Ai as smart as a bacteria. Kind of.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>I won't get into much details, but you may be very skeptical of the last part in the second paragraph. Or even the third one. As you should. And if you are, do your homework. You'll probably find out I'm not too far off from the reality.</p>
<p>"How can Ai help countries in need" could be a way to reword your question. Then, which country don't need help from a superior intelligence? Why focusing only on "developing" countries? Of course there must be something we can do for everyone and most of "everyone" are in the poor region, but make no mistake - most people are poor because they prefer the simplicity of life. Capitalism isn't a zero-sum game and everyone have a choice in one way or another. There sure is misery out there, but even that is almost like a choice.</p>
<p>Here, this is a very geeky pseudo-code I just wrote about Life:</p>

<a href="/talk/t/why-so-many-people-have-the-illusion-chance-plays-no-role-in-life/69">Chance</a>? 

I just wrote this on <a href="/talk/t/thank-you-for-the-warning-about-crossover/7829/4?u=cregox">another topic</a>, and here I bring it as a wiki: 



 illusion = 0

async choice:
    result = 0.34 * random * illusion
    delay 8  # seconds
    return result

Life:
    born = 0.33 * random  # either 0 or 1
    happy = random
    dead = random
 
    while not dead:
        illusion = random  # perception
        luck = 0.33 * random * illusion
        happy = (born + luck + choice) &gt; 0.5 # is the glass half full?
        dead = random

</aside>

<p>In my humble opinion, the best way to use Ai in favor of our humanity is by doing what most intelligent people are already doing and heavily investing into making something like openai.com - a free, open and non profit Ai code, made by everyone, aiming at improving our mental health.</p>
