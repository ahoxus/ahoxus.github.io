              <p>Hey,</p>

<p>I stumbled over a super interesting article by you on Quora. <br>Then I clicked the link, and BOOM: Basiux. I was sold at the very first sentence.</p>

<p>But here's the thing:<br>- So hard to get in touch with you<br>- No clear message on website on how you plan to attain your goal (ASI)<br>- And when you eventually pass the pain-in-the-ass'ish process of signing up to cregox etc... what do we see? Job hunting. Design. Q&amp;A's about your job. <br>Dude, that's disappointing.</p>

<p>On one of your posts you (early posts I believe) you say they're only 3 people on your mailing list. Don't wonder why.</p>

<p>So all that to say that it's really a shame. Your article on Quora was brilliant. Your wordpress just makes people want for more or be a part of the big adventure. But looks like you don't really take care of this (maybe I'm wrong and you do, but it really doesn't look like you do, and that's a huge communication mistake), and it's hardto get the clear message, so even harder to actually engage your audience to your project.</p>

<p>Anyway, just a point of view from someone interested by ASI that found your comment awesome (and quite into marketing and communication..). </p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Seb</p>

<p>EDIT:<br>Re-read my post and realized it can be understood in a wrong way. So don't get me wrong, this post is about improving your idea/plan. I get the fact that you need to work/eat/live/sleep, but you should definitely separate that from Basiux.</p>
