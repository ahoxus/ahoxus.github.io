<p>anyway, back to topic.</p>

<p><video width="100%" height="100%" controls><source src="https://openai-sci-demonstrations.s3.amazonaws.com/site-assets/karpathy/flashgames_6x11.mp4"><a href="https://openai-sci-demonstrations.s3.amazonaws.com/site-assets/karpathy/flashgames_6x11.mp4">https://openai-sci-demonstrations.s3.amazonaws.com/site-assets/karpathy/flashgames_6x11.mp4</a></source></video><br><em>a sample of Universe game environments played by human demonstrators.</em></p>

<p>one day before openai newest release <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/to-kstanley-can-a-neat-mario-start-up-a-basiux/7914/5?u=cregox">I was officially starting to try getting basiux back up</a>. I saw the news and left it on my "read later" list. then, a few hours after replying to mr Stanley there, I finally got to see what <a href="https://universe.openai.com/">openai universe</a> was all about. and...</p>

<p>yet again, they have a lot of similar aspects from what I want to do / see being done. it surprised me, as I wasn't expecting they would continue on going through such a related route at all. plus, the work there is <strong>amazing</strong>!</p>

<p>still, and yet again (again), it doesn't come without its flaws, at least the way I see.</p>

<p>the main issue might also be their biggest win: it's not easy enough to contribute. you do need to install docker, universe and at least toy with python to get in the boat. of course this easily can prove to be beneficial for their goals or even for basiux as a whole, but I'm pretty positive this is a bad choice for bringing it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>making it so generic and, at the same time, focusing on game learning, doesn't rub me in a good way as well. it's a great plan for helping us in figuring out better algorithms, which we still need to do. but not so much for improving a good algorithm or making it grow in the most beneficial way. for all we currently know today, we might already have good enough algorithms and they'd just be lacking a proper tweak along with combined hardware power. if we limit its inputs to keyboard and pixels from games, probably no algorithm today would have enough resources to raise up as a basiux.</p>

<p>and what does all this means to us?</p>

<p>I guess not much.</p>

<p>we still gotta build something to showcase basiux's value. maybe it can now incorporate this universe, maybe it can't, doesn't really matter. if we can't easily use it, it'll probably be better to stick with the plan for now: make a hyper neat mariox so anyone can play with it and effortlessly "share Ai benchmarks for transfer learning" (as they put it).</p>

<p>in another hand, if you want to better understand basiux current efforts, well, now we can simply say:</p>

<blockquote><p>we want to build a kind of openai universe for any user, focused on making it fun and social</p></blockquote>

<p>controversially, if this helps us explaining our plan, in itself is already quite a lot! (in opposite to "not much")</p>

<p>also, maybe <a href="http://discuss.openai.com/">their forums</a> (also using discourse - regardless of <a href="http://blog.cregox.com/2015/12/25/new-blog-platform-once-again.html">how "terrible"</a> it is, <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/welcome-to-cregox-talk/6/1">we're still using it</a> too) can bring us much value as well.</p>

<p>as for the <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/true-randomness-app-why-it-could-help-winning-the-lottery-and-building-up-the-basiux/7845?u=cregox">latest plan about randomness</a>, well, it's obviously too bold of a bet for this stage. hopefully later, supposing it eventually pins out. <img src="https://talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

          <title>True randomness app, why it could help winning the lottery and building up the basiux</title>

<br><em>to me, this image is truly <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/search?q=random">random</a> for this topic context</em></p>

<p>This is my little "theory" taken right off my butt. Play with it if you want, I'll sure write an app for this in case nobody wants to take on the challenge... And I bet you it will be better than anything you see on the market, including <a href="https://www.random.org/analysis/">Random.org</a> (guess which image below is the true random one).</p>

<p><a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/differences-between-free-will-randomness-and-or-determinism/7804">The universe is deterministic</a> and if we could have the exact variables at the big bang plus enough computational power, we could simulate ours very easily. That may never happen though, since "enough computational power" is probably not possible for computers are inside the universe. It's almost like trying to create a perpetual energy machine - that energy has to come from somewhere. Nothing we know in science points to such a possibility so no such machine that's claimed to be "scientific" is true. "<strong>Impossible</strong>" is a thing, "impossible" certainly exists, specially when we look in retrospect: before airplanes it was indeed impossible to fly at such speeds.</p>

<p>But...</p>

<p>That doesn't mean we can't build models around those initial variables to reach approximate states with much less computer power. Much, much less. We can, today, compress text, image and even videos (i.e. anything meaningful to us) to less than 9% of its original size, very easily.</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="9rIy0xY99a0" data-youtube-title="What is Random?" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

<p>Randomness is what makes data meaningful. Given a data point is not too <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/quick-random-thought-about-wtf-contact-requests/7646">random</a> we simply call it pattern instead. That is, meaningful data we can recognize.</p>

<p>Now let's talk a bit more crazy. The universe is connected. Coincidences can be very meaningful. When they happen at the same time, even more. Thanks to that, any random data point from previous lotteries that happened right on the same exact time of lottery balls dropping are much more meaningful than any other random data set you can get, to build statistical models.</p>

<p>Finally, that history of previous lotteries data points is not more important than any other history of any other big event happening... Enter <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/random-what-now/48">true randomness</a>.</p>

<p>Random.org grabs atmospherical data to randomize numbers on an otherwise digital world unable to generate unrecognizable patterns. So, all we need to do to have such thing in the palm of our hands is grab noise from the environment. And yes, it can be just as good as rolling the dice or whatever other random tool from the physical world because we're bringing in physical data into the computah!!</p>

<p>Yeah baby.</p>

<p>So... As for the app...</p>

<p>Use the microphone, the camera, the antenna, the clock, wifi signals, compass, everything to "randomize" the numbers!</p>

<p>And remember to make a good app <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/checklist-for-a-good-enough-android-podcast-player-like-apples/7096">checklist</a>, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>big numbers</li>
<li>simple interface, bring in everything in one screen</li>
<li>swipe left or right to change results from dice, to coins, lottery, whatever</li>
<li>keep it under 1mb at most (ideally 100kb), or make it using unity3d at once</li>
<li>keep history</li>
<li>offline and online backup (for history)</li>
<li>no ads, no revenue other than in app sales for coin skins or whatever perfume</li>
<li><em>(more to come)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, this could help the basiux because this kind of true randomness can be used for much more meaningful genetic evolution, in case it does pinout as being better over a high enough amount of iterations. It will be impossible for me to test this alone, though.</p>

I didn't want to watch this movie last night.

<p>If you haven't watched it, do yourself a favor. You may even get disappointed at first, you may not see why that's related to basiux... Well, try again. Keep trying.</p>

<p><details><summary>Spoiler about what's basiux about.</summary>

<p>Above all, about spreading the love. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/heart.png?v=0" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:"> </p>

<p>Other than that, it really teaches us nothing about neural networks, genetic algorithm or Ai, I think. But the main concepts we need to build into basiux are all there. This is, actually, very relevant.</p>

<p>This probably means almost nothing else, but... I found it <strong>amazing</strong> stumbling at such an awesome chatbot on the wild <strong>and</strong> being able to identify it rather quickly.</p>

<p>Here in the heart of Lisbon, near the Castle, we still don't have fiber and ADSL is terrible. 1mb up, very limited and quite unstable for my current internet usage (especially thanks to Narrative Clip). Reason why I went out to search for unlimited 3G and once I could find none in Portugal I decided to go international. T-Mobile was my second hit on my first google attempt (for "unlimited 4g data plan europe"), but enough context.</p>

<p>Maybe even more uncanny was I couldn't find anything about T-Jessica! Of course, chatbot Jessica is very common, and there are plenty nice programs out there. Some of them can already pass the turing test, and then again, there's IBM beating games such as chess, jeopardy or making the insane Watson. There is indeed a lot, and I mean a lot of A.i. prototypes out there doing insane things. But there is also a chance of no bot out there being as capable as this one. At least speaking english... I only regret not having asked her if she spoke german. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>Hopefully the best part of this, so far, will be it led me to accidentally find <a href="http://viv.ai">viv.ai</a>, while googling for "tmobile artificial intelligence" I <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2608784/mobile-apps/smarter-than-siri--viv-promises-a-truly-intelligent-assistant.html">got it</a> (as 2nd hit again) and there was no "tmobile" anywhere in there. Just lots of "mobile" menus and keyword items. This will be awesome if they were either indeed behind T-Jessica for a scooped realization there or if they decide to pay attention to <a href="http://basiux.org">basiux</a> after my contact attempts! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/sunglasses.png?v=0" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:"></p>

            <p><a href="http://talk.cregox.com/u/cregox">@cregox</a> wrote:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Almost 1 month ago, while <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/a-s-i-or-job-hunting/7717?u=cregox">talking to @BesseB</a>, I was challenged to do this. So, here we go...</p>

<h1>What is "<strong>The Singularity</strong>"?</h1>

<p>There will be a time in the near future, within this century, where computers will become much, much smarter than humans. Most specialists agree it will come. Nobody knows what it will be like. When it does come, everything that everyone were planning to do the next day shall change!</p>

<p>It may not come as sudden as overnight, though. It may even take a few years.</p>

<h2>And what is "basiux"?</h2>

<p>A group of people who believe <em>the explosion</em> will probably happen basically overnight. And it will be an awesome event for everyone. Something just a few of us will be hoping for and everyone will be able to enjoy. Most likely nobody will be expecting exactly when.</p>

<p>All of that is possible because of a specific topic within computers. Artificial Intelligence. Or A.i. for short.</p>

<h1>But what is Intelligence?</h1>

<p>One way to define it is "<em>the capacity of predicting the future</em>". In every aspect. To be able to hit baseball with a bat, you have to see the ball, recognise its path in the air and predict where it will be. Then you have to move muscles in a very complex way as to hold the bat and move it into the precise point of collision. All that within just a few milliseconds. That's a huge sign of intelligence right there, that almost no other living being, or machine, can replicate today. Well, even a lot of humans can't manage to do it, but there is the capacity for almost any of us.</p>

<p>Maybe if we get an elephant's brain inside an android (a theoretical machine that replicates the human body, a robot that doesn't exist) the elephant could do a better job than us. Maybe. Because their brain might have higher capacity than ours, but if it's true their body probably limit its intelligence growth. It could also be they're missing a fundamental growth component in their being. <strong>Maybe</strong> their cortex, a main component of the human brain associated with alzheimer's (when people get to old and stop being themselves) is just wired differently. Just maybe.</p>

<p>Ai is intelligence created by humans (that's actually what "artificial" means). Email spam filters are a good example. They are software applications (a group of algorithms) that can anticipate if the email user would classify that email as something they don't want to read. Spam.</p>

<h1>How do we, people of the world, work on developing Ai today?</h1>

<p>Mostly we create programs able to do very tiny and specific tasks, compared to humans. Programmers have to write tons of lines of code, telling a dumb processor on what it needs to do to accomplish such tasks.</p>

<p>Most, if not all, of our top notch Ai programs evolve a lot like we do: by repetition. To learn how to walk, we try to stand up and fall down. Many times. One day, we can start walking. The only way we know of predicting the future (being intelligent) is through analysing the past, so we got to record experiences and evaluate them.</p>

<h1>Why even bother creating such robots?</h1>

<p>Are you kidding?! Even those "dumb" pieces of software we have made gives us huge benefits! Think about some of the tremendous technological milestones. The wheel. The sewer system...</p>

<p>We can't move forward as a global society, as the humankind race, without serious advancements in technology. It's the practical result of all our thoughts on how we can improve the quality of life for every single one, and the only thing able to get us closer to such goal.</p>

<h1>And how basiux envision Singularity can be attained?</h1>

<p>This can only be discussed philosophically. And that gets really subjective. It's all a matter of faith, funny enough. <strong>At this point, there is just no way to know how.</strong> Nobody in their sane mind can even assert it will happen. It <em>may</em> never happen. All we can do is keep researching and hoping. But from what we know today, there is an immense chance it will happen. So in what direction should we go?</p>

<p>Extrapolating, it's easy to see it's just a matter of keep evolving the algorithms, the whole software and the hardware, and eventually we would end up creating something that could resemble a Super Intelligence. That's a very dangerous way. It's much more likely we end up creating a less intelligent thing, which we can control. How can it be so much more intelligent than us and still be under our control? It can't. By this point, it's just a massive weapon that can easily escape our control or misinterpret any of our commands and boom. Game over.</p>

<p>Just like anything else we as a species, or we as individuals, learn to do or to build, we need many prototypes and trial and errors. Except, for this, we may not get a second chance. Picture an atomic bomb able to destroy the world. This is not so energetic, the world wouldn't blow up... But we could be biologically exterminated. Unfortunately there are no films depicting this properly. None.</p>

<p>So, another way we could go is not trying to control it. Just make it grow. Engineer the seed, plant it, watch carefully and closely. Make a mistake, it will die. Have a kill switch ready to be activated before it grows too big. Make it to grow fast and by itself, though, quickly decreasing the need of mentoring and monitoring, just enough to make it get on its own feet. Analogous feet, it will all be software only.</p>

<h1>Wait, what? How are those 2 ways any different?!</h1>

<p>The way we're doing today is the first one. Indeed they look very alike. We are trying to engineer a seed and teach it to grow. But if the tree starts to seek some sunlight, we cut it off, and teach it "go straight". We're trying, as hard as possible, to keep every single thing under our control, so we can do whatever we think is important. The financial aspect of this is just 1 side.</p>

<h1>Not following</h1>

<p>It doesn't matter. In practice, there's only 1 way the singularity won't happen this century: if we get extinct first. For any other reason. Again, it's so unlikely the singularity would represent any danger to us that, right now, I'm not even sure why I said it could be any harm. Maybe that's part of the discussion and research that needs to be done and verify this not-yet-a-theory idea.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, we need to make this happen as fast as possible. But if we can't, well, bummer. It was already <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/why-so-many-people-have-the-illusion-chance-plays-no-role-in-life/69">expected</a>! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=1" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>Hey,</p>

<p>I stumbled over a super interesting article by you on Quora. <br>Then I clicked the link, and BOOM: Basiux. I was sold at the very first sentence.</p>

<p>But here's the thing:<br>- So hard to get in touch with you<br>- No clear message on website on how you plan to attain your goal (ASI)<br>- And when you eventually pass the pain-in-the-ass'ish process of signing up to cregox etc... what do we see? Job hunting. Design. Q&amp;A's about your job. <br>Dude, that's disappointing.</p>

<p>On one of your posts you (early posts I believe) you say they're only 3 people on your mailing list. Don't wonder why.</p>

<p>So all that to say that it's really a shame. Your article on Quora was brilliant. Your wordpress just makes people want for more or be a part of the big adventure. But looks like you don't really take care of this (maybe I'm wrong and you do, but it really doesn't look like you do, and that's a huge communication mistake), and it's hardto get the clear message, so even harder to actually engage your audience to your project.</p>

<p>Anyway, just a point of view from someone interested by ASI that found your comment awesome (and quite into marketing and communication..). </p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Seb</p>

<p>EDIT:<br>Re-read my post and realized it can be understood in a wrong way. So don't get me wrong, this post is about improving your idea/plan. I get the fact that you need to work/eat/live/sleep, but you should definitely separate that from Basiux.</p>

<p>Okay, one of them is my mom, but it still makes the number bigger than zero. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=0" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>I just wanted to say I have halted my work on basiux due to lots of personal life changes. Namely, moving with my wife from Brazil to Portugal.</p>

<p>But my will to continue have never been bigger. Mostly I'll still <a href="http://s.cregox.com/basiux-research">continue researching somehow</a> and trying to position myself. I've stumbled on a few rocks for that last part.</p>

<p>There's really nothing to be said except that the project is still alive and unmatched. Found nobody else clearly pursuing this same goal and specially none being vocal enough for me to hear it.</p>

<p>Also, I've <a href="https://github.com/basiux/basiux.github.io/commit/ca5709ac4050ee6d23de04960d241a9ad540b672">changed</a> the mailing list away from mailchimp. It means it's a bit harder to sign up as you now have to choose a name and a password or use a single sign on (in which case it might become easier if you already got it set up), but it's much more worth it as it prevents spammers and creates a sense of community. It also facilitates posting news for me and to whoever else wants to participate.</p>

<p>To finish up this <em>first "mailing"</em>, the quotes are there to sign this probably won't be emailed to anyone yet, as nobody is <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/wiki/Basic-Usage-Guide#category-notifications">watching the category</a>. So, if you're interested, go ahead and sign up. Then watch it up. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>Bigger news are yet to come!</p>
