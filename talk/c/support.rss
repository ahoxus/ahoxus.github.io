<p>Hope you are well.</p>

<p>You did a small Squarespace modification for me about a year ago. It was adding thumbnails to the blog page on my website: <a href="http://www.formulate.com.au/blog/" rel="nofollow">http://www.formulate.com.au/blog/</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve just posted another blog entry (“Is inline validation out?”) and the thumbnail is not showing. Can you help me work out what’s wrong?</p>

<p>Many thanks,</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>

<p>My wife and I running a wedding videography company and are in the process of building our website on Squarespace and we've ran into a little snag.  We would like to have a gallery to display our videos, which are hosted on Vimeo, but don't like the options for video galleries that they offer.  What I would like to do is start with a blank page and add photos our our couples to it so that we can size them and arrange them however we would like, instead of sticking to the confines of the gallery.  I've attached an image to give you and idea of what I am thinking.  When a picture is clicked on, I would like the corresponding video to open up in a lightbox covering most of the screen.  I've tried to accomplish this using some of the code you have out there for doing the same idea with buttons, but haven't been able to get it to work properly.</p>

<p>Are you available to hire to come up with a solution, or if you already have one would you mind leading me in the right direction?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hello Caue,</p>
<p>For the Squarespace web site for a new iOS app I'm launching, my design has<br>a cover photo on the home page with two play buttons for videos - one on<br>the left and one on the right. The video triggered by the play button on<br>the left can be full screen, letter boxed. The video triggered by the play<br>button on the right is in the shape of an iPhone in portrait mode - i.e.<br>vertical orientation.</p>
<p>My reason for having these two play buttons is that I have two videos that<br>communicate two different, parallel marketing messages about the app, like<br>Lite Beer from Miller Lite's old "Tastes Great, Less Filling" ad campaign.<br>( <a href="http://buildingpharmabrands.com/2013/04/26/great-taste-less-filling/">http://buildingpharmabrands.com/2013/04/26/great-taste-less-filling/</a> )</p>
<p>Can you help me with this?</p>
<p>Once I solve this problem, I'll still need to build the rest of that page,<br>another page, and two forms pages. I'll probably ask help from someone -<br>you or someone else.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Subject: lazy loading for squarespace grid gallery</p>
<p>Message: Hello,</p>
<p>I have found some work you made for a squarespace ecommerce shop and I<br>thought you might be able help me.</p>
<p>I am going crazy with finding a way to implement lazy loading/infinite<br>scrolling on my wedding website without going into developer mode.</p>
<p>Could you provide some script for me? obviously, I am happy to pay for your<br>time.</p>
<p>Here is the gallery i am dealing with :<br><a href="http://www.melanieandroberto.com/test" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.melanieandroberto.com/test</a></p>
<p>Without lazy loading it takes ages to load.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Roberto.</p>

<p>Subject: Help with multiple issues on a Squarespace project</p>
<p>Message: First, a little context: the website is the portfolio for an<br>architect. It starts with a cover page that links to the portuguese and the<br>english version of the website. The english version is actually a second<br>squarespace project, identical to the first and pointing to a subdomain.</p>
<p>The issues I need to fix are the following:</p>
<p>COVER PAGE</p>
<p>- Logo on cover page is not centrally aligned on mobile. It is always a<br>little to the right, and depending on the screen size, a lot to the right.</p>
<p>SITE IN PORTUGUESE</p>
<p>- The site is not loading properly on mobile (smartphones or ipads). The<br>layout is rendered too different from what the template is supposed to look<br>like (http://flatiron-demo.squarespace.com/).</p>
<p>- on the page “projetos”, the name of each project is not showing up on top<br>of the picture, as it should do.</p>
<p>- On a project’s page, images should occupy the whole screen, but are<br>actually rather small and aligned to the right. In some smartphones, the<br>images simply don’t load.</p>
<p>SITE IN ENGLISH</p>
<p>- For some reason, it seems like on mobile devices, the website is not<br>loading the same visual template as the portuguese site.</p>
<p>- On a project’s page, images should occupy the whole screen, but are<br>actually rather small and aligned to the right. In some smartphones, the<br>images simply don’t load.</p>
<p>- The website is supposed to appear under the subdomain<br>“english.semerene.com”, but it is not working very well. If I click in any<br>link, even for another website, it keeps showing on the URL address the<br>same “english.semerene.com”. Try clicking on the logo, for example. It<br>leads you to the same page hosted on “semerene.com”, but the address bar<br>shows “english.semerene.com”.</p>
<p>INSTAGRAM BLOCK</p>
<p>- On page “diario visual” or “visual journal”: for some reason, there is a<br>“hole” on the grid of instagram images.</p>

<p>However I don't want this to effect any other blocks on other pages.</p>

<p>Any advice very much appreciated </p>

<p>I've been doing my best in following your instructions but I still couldn't<br>get it to work. It would be extremely helpful if you could point me in the<br>right direction and tell me what I'm doing wrong.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of my page so far. I'm using a sample video from Vimeo<br>as the video I want to use is not done yet.</p>

<p>I'm trying to place a button on the homepage that plays a full screen video<br>in a lightbox. As you can see, I've already done the following:</p>
<p>1. Added a gallery block (set to Grid and open in lightbox)<br>2. Added a button above the gallery block (Add the jquery code into it)<br>3. Added a code block below the video and pasted the long code that you<br>provided</p>
<p>I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong and I hope you can help me out.</p>
<p>Your help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>-Reduce the space between lines for single items in the mobile menu.</p>
<p>-Compress folders in the mobile menu (plus to expand)</p>
<p>-Move the Nav bar to the bottom of the screen for mobile site only</p>
<p>-Loop gallery (have arrow on last image to loop to the beginning of the gallery)</p>
<p>-Use + sign instead of info sign (i in circle)</p>
<p>-Remove header/header space on pages</p>
<p>-Keep gallery view background opaque with menus still transparent.</p>

              <p>Hi, do you know if its possible to format the price-list page like this: <a href="http://stikkogreis.no/priser/" rel="nofollow">http://stikkogreis.no/priser/</a> in Squarespace.</p>

<p>That you have both white and grey horisontal columns that help dividing the text.</p>

<p>Thanks, <br>Tor Martin</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I found you through squarespace specialists.  I just made a new site for my<br>company and am not as web savvy as I'd like and need css coding or coding<br>in general and there are a few things I would like to have done and wanted<br>to get a quote.</p>
<p>Here is my website: <a href="http://www.helloairbot.com">www.helloairbot.com</a></p>
<p>I am using the template horizon and I am hosting my videos through wistia.<br>I need code done to get my cover video to auto play upon page load.  It's<br>currently in a gallery and you have to press the play button.   It will<br>auto play with a code block but I need code for the block to stretch like<br>the video currently looks in the gallery.    My old site I was using the<br>shift template for the parallaxing pages but I wanted the one page scroller<br>so horizon seemed to be the perfect fit.</p>
<p>So what I need is custom code to make my cover video auto play in the code<br>block size I need.  I would like to get a couple of my pages to parallax<br>and I want some drop shadow on some of my pictures/pages as well.  I would<br>also like to get the hover overlays with the titles of my videos like the<br>site below as well.<br>-----------&gt;<a href="http://www.motionstate.com">www.motionstate.com</a> is a site that has the parallaxing and drop<br>shadow, and graphic hover elements I want.</p>
<p>If you could give me a quote on how much you would charge to make these<br>changes to my site happen I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>
