<p><strong>keep</strong> is, imho, extremely superior to <strong>evernote</strong> for a single reason: it just works. everywhere and fast. no installation even needed.</p>

<p>both have a huge problem: no automated local backups. not even with ifttt or whatever. both can recover from a time machine backup, but it's not all that reliable and it wouldn't really survive the product being pulling off. they both <em>think</em> they'll exist forever and the web is at least 99.999%.</p>

<p>keep probably don't work offline as good as evernote as well, and the elephant has an awesome OCR. but keep have notes colors, an awesome grid view, easy to take simple or complex notes and blazing fast to search them, etc. you know, it's a google product.</p>

<p>google's have a bigger problem: it's <strong>google</strong>. <a href="https://gigaom.com/2013/03/20/sorry-google-you-can-keep-it-to-yourself/">who knows what's going to be the next reader shut down</a>?</p>

<p>the simple solution would be making independent teams within google, who could easily be their own company if google feels the need to pull the plug. also people can follow products by the people, which is what should matter most. sorry apple, jobs less apple is another company. and it will "die", at very least, like ibm and microsoft did.</p>

<p>the ideal candidate to win over both? <strong>github</strong>. but it's not there yet, as well... funny enough, for GitHub I'm only missing a simple unified gui experience in every single platform, which is much easier to overcome than any other problem from the concurrents.</p>

<p>when I join in around minute 11 everything slows down for a while, I was already sleepy and trying to figure out why it was so slow, and it was obviously thanks to my terrible non-fiber 0.5 mbps upstream internet here at historical lisbon center. <strong>I promise the broadcast gets better</strong> later on, if you enjoy artificial intelligence, science and / or philosophy.</p>

<p>topics touched:</p>

<ul>
<li>autonomous cars and tesla ( <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/models">https://www.teslamotors.com/models</a> )</li>
<li>tesla and elon musk ( <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/models">https://www.teslamotors.com/models</a> )</li>
<li>academia Ai</li>
<li>net neutrality</li>
<li>golf bot and tiger woods</li>
<li>chicken or the egg ( <a href="http://www.basiux.org/#mariox">www.basiux.org/#mariox</a> )</li>
<li>reinforced mixed learning</li>
<li>bitcoins</li>
<li>universe determinism</li>
</ul>

<p>I participate in those since the first one (but unfortunately not in all of them) and I think anyone can join. this is the first one I'm aware that's being broadcast, but just near the ending. <code>Moe</code> does a great job <a href="http://timezone.io/team/codenewbieai">organizing</a> 'em and putting things together, along with <a href="https://codenewbie.slack.com/archives/ai/p1454713220000253">the slack channel</a>.</p>

<p>now, this is just in: <a href="https://codenewbie.slack.com/archives/basiux">that hangout may</a> soon become <a href="/talk/t/lets-make-a-podcast/7753">the podcast</a>!!</p>

Movies are all about storytelling. 

Disclaimer about The Rating Scale

For the longest time, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/user/ur1256176/?ref_=nv_usr_prof_2">my IMDB profile</a> says something like this: 

 

Also for the longest time, I wished to make a better <a href="/talk/t/anything-advisor/7426">rating system</a> in general. Maybe <a href="/talk/t/from-wildcard-through-computers-to-the-unknown/7636?u=cregox">the first manifestation</a> of that wish happened almost 1 year ago. Something like <a href="http://slant.co">slant.co</a> but maybe even simpler and even better. 

After (re)watching [Strictly Sexual] yesterday, finding it a 10, and having to re-scale it from 7, I've decided to finally starting do…

<p><small>This was hard to summarize in such a small space, but it's also not that big of a buffer. I would normally add this to <a href="/c/buffer/fun">fun</a> but, being an RFC, I guess tech suits better.</small></p>

<p>No photos in this post (as I try to always do in buffer) because the link has it all and this is a lot of reading material.</p>

<p>The links with deeper explanations are all there, including for "the advisor", on the right side. The explanation is also there, on the Disclaimer. So, I guess the only thing left to say is: <strong>could</strong> you <strong>please <em>read it all</em></strong> and then <strong>comment</strong>? <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=1" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>A short guide to social media in general (even while focused on twitter) for newbies like me.</p>

<p>This is just my humble opinion main points summed up from <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/twitter-tips-for-beginners?utm_content=bufferd5efc&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">yet another great buffer post</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>A good bio sells. Be descriptive. Add:<ul>
<li>accuracy. One professional description.</li>
<li>excitement. One word that is not boring.</li>
<li>target. One niche descriptor.</li>
<li>flattering. One accomplishment.</li>
<li>human element. Such as 01 hobby.</li>
<li>intrigue. One interesting fact or feature about yourself.</li>
<li>connection. Your company or another social profile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Respond to everyone. Engage.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/talk/t/when-is-10-not-enough-little-prince/7772">Follow everyone. Spread the love.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Once again, from the title: <strong>Be social. Talk about everyone, not you</strong>. And, by all means, do it from your point of view! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=1" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p></li>

(1) Singularity based on Moore still looks quite possible to happen as Moore continues to be reliable even today. To me it only means that computers will get faster and at some poin…
