<p>This is just a quote to this link for my answer on quora: <a href="http://qr.ae/ROw3G7">http://qr.ae/ROw3G7</a></p>

<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote>
<p>In short: it's already helping. Everyone. When you google for something, there's a huge big data Ai in place to give you the best answers. Try Siri and you'll have a glimpse of what Ai can do, and that's still a very weak Ai.</p>
<p>Do you need more than getting answers to any important question almost instantly? Well, the best games out there use heavy Ai - the biggest e-sport game in DOTA style is also one with the most advanced Ai systems in place. How that helps? It helps easing up our mind from the craziness around. A mindfulness technique.</p>
<p>And, yet, all is using Ai as smart as a bacteria. Kind of.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>I won't get into much details, but you may be very skeptical of the last part in the second paragraph. Or even the third one. As you should. And if you are, do your homework. You'll probably find out I'm not too far off from the reality.</p>
<p>"How can Ai help countries in need" could be a way to reword your question. Then, which country don't need help from a superior intelligence? Why focusing only on "developing" countries? Of course there must be something we can do for everyone and most of "everyone" are in the poor region, but make no mistake - most people are poor because they prefer the simplicity of life. Capitalism isn't a zero-sum game and everyone have a choice in one way or another. There sure is misery out there, but even that is almost like a choice.</p>
<p>Here, this is a very geeky pseudo-code I just wrote about Life:</p>

 illusion = 0

async choice:
    result = 0.34 * random * illusion
    delay 8  # seconds
    return result

Life:
    born = 0.33 * random  # either 0 or 1
    happy = random
    dead = random
 
    while not dead:
        illusion = random  # perception
        luck = 0.33 * random * illusion

<p>In my humble opinion, the best way to use Ai in favor of our humanity is by doing what most intelligent people are already doing and heavily investing into making something like openai.com - a free, open and non profit Ai code, made by everyone, aiming at improving our mental health.</p>

<p>outreaching is where most of the work is done, and there are many tools you can use, although none is really needed. the point is making good questions to ask them on their field of expertise, so you'll have both great content to compile and an audience who will love to hear other experts feedback on that same question.</p>

<p>the steps are in much detail although not really so well described in <a href="http://www.matthewwoodward.co.uk/tutorials/crowdsource-blog-content">this ugly link</a>, but I promise getting aware of the core idea there is <strong>very</strong> interesting.</p>

<p>I haven't done it myself just yet, for it is a lot of work and, well, I couldn't set my mind to do it. But I will, and it will be awesome! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slightly_smiling.png?v=1" title=":slightly_smiling:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling:"></p>

also, for context, I wrote the post while I was very inspired and <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/two-weeks-i-havent-updated-the-novel-any-ideas-or-feedback-anyone/7806">writing the 3 novel chapters</a> that will probably not get any bigger unless people manifest themselves. 

since then, I've also added a buffer post about this. 

novels, being a creation of human imagination, and the hugely flawed human brain, have no validation on the much bigger REAL UNIVERSE, the one and only, basiux's true GOD (church of tech's god is basiux, but basiux's god is the universe). 

yes…

<p>By re-reading that post, I thought it would fit better here in <a href="/c/buffer">buffer</a> given its size.

              <p>If you're not getting any more financial results, that's probably the only sign you need to see the whole "job" culture is changing. Maybe that's the main reason why we need to change our mindsets too.</p>

<p>I wrote all of the below before reading <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/o-e-mail-que-me-levou-at%C3%A9-sede-do-google-em-s%C3%A3o-galileu-nogueira?deepLinkCommentId=6092633209772789762&amp;anchorTime=1452596952874&amp;trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_REPLY_TOP_LEVEL_COMMENT">a very inspiring article (in portuguese)</a> which basically brings the same idea but made me look at it from another angle, to which I changed the title from "<em>Why you should apply only for jobs that matter</em>".</p>

<hr>

<p>For one, because you'll regret if you do get a meaningless job, no matter how high the amount paid. You just will, sooner or later. Unless you are one in a gazillion that may indeed have no physiological mind issues with it (as always, words are carefully chosen here).</p>

<p>Also because nobody should be applying for jobs. We need to focus on <strong>working</strong> with what matters and job or talent hunting is, ideally, someone's job! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=1" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>

<p>But, since we're not living <em>yet</em> in <strong>that</strong> ideal world, well, let's keep trying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whatever_Works">whatever works (love that flick)</a>. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=1" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>This came actually from <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/dont-know-why-i-cant-stop-applying-for-jobs/7661/6">Don't know why I can't stop applying for jobs</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.cregox.com/2015/12/26/the-next-ai-poca-lips.html">This is the first release</a> and then I <a href="http://blog.cregox.com/2015/12/27/making-of-the-next-ai-poca-lips.html">announced</a> moving it to the <a href="https://github.com/cauerego/cauerego.github.io/wiki/a-novel">wiki, where it now stays</a>.</p>

<p>Although I haven't touched <em>the novel</em> in 2 weeks, <a href="https://github.com/cauerego/cauerego.github.io/wiki/a-novel-about-the-other-novel">the making of</a> have been a bit updated in just little more than 1 week and I have written 2 stories since then as well, <a href="http://blog.cregox.com/2015/12/31/cregox-navigator-around-the-world.html">one about traveling</a> and the other one <a href="http://blog.cregox.com/2016/01/05/what-s-wrong-with-bars-and-drinks.html">trying to make comedy</a>, which should also be done in <em>the novel</em>.</p>

<p>I think I can't find any more inspiration / energy right now with the almost zero amount of feedback I'm getting - other than those astonishing and glamouring kindest words from a new friend, of course. "<em>The guy who will make the new Matrix</em>" he said, and he wasn't joking nor being silly.</p>

<p>Well, yeah, I think that sums it up. So. I'll repeat my echoing message from other posts in this abandoned ghost town... Anyone there?</p>

<p>I guess I just forgot about one of my latest posts! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=1" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

target. One niche descriptor.
flattering. One accomplishment.

<p>That triggered me to do some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie">wikipedia</a> reading, all on the mobile. IMHO, he was luckily born in an easy place to live, enjoyed financial freedom for ever, plus quickly figured out what sex and religion is all about in his heart - i.e. he wasn't tainted by all his freedom and did manage to set his mind in the right place - unlike most people especially in famous positions as his.</p>

<p>Dying 2 days after being 69 on top of it all? Such a meaningful number with the most common cause of death in the recent days? If I were living his life and had to choose a time and place to die, I couldn't do any better. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=1" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
