<p>for this weekend I've got even more on my hands than the first 2, so there's absolutely no preparation! even the time have changed, today (sunday and not saturday) it will <strong>start around 21:00 utc</strong> so 7 hours from now.</p>

<p>boy, I wonder if I'll ever be able to get this better organized... <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=1" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>so, this was a short one.</p>

<p>as expected, nobody came, so I ended it up sooner. the trilogy is done and over and I'm glad it's finished. now to the next project!</p>

<p>scientifically I'd say you could think of Ai with 3 axis: <em>logic</em>, <em>philosophy</em> and <em>arts</em>.</p>
<p><em>(if this answer gets enough interest I'll expand more)</em></p>
<p><strong>logic</strong><br>that's the binary world, the same one that constructs math and progamming*. you can't have any kind of intelligence without a solid logic.</p>
<p><strong>philosophy</strong><br>this is the spiritual world, looked upon mostly through logic (i.e. with much intelligence).</p>
<p><strong>arts</strong><br>materialization. Ai is a lot about ideas but nothing of that matters if you can't bring it to the real world. making a spam filter out of pure logic is an awesome piece art and, make no mistake, programming is a form of art! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=1" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>---</p>
<p>there really is nothing in your life you can't use to learn about researching for Ai, specially if you're talking about the tech singularity. <strong>anything works</strong>.</p>
<p>now, if all you want is weak Ai, the one being sold today, you can leave <strong>philosophy</strong> behind and focus most your efforts in <strong>logic</strong> and, if you're lucky enough, make tons of money with it, with a good enough <strong>art</strong>. just keep in mind money isn't everything - it's just 1/3 of it.</p>

<p>are you sure? <span class="spoiler">yay, I found a cancerogenous papaya which tastes good!</span></p>

<p></p></details></p>

<p>if you know me you should be able to guess it properly as <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-do-I-need-to-learn-in-order-to-research-artificial-intelligence/answer/Caue-Rego">the right answer is one filled with 3 elements</a>: <strong>logic + art + philosophy</strong>.</p>

<p>( still unsure of what's the best category for buffering this... since it's on "help", the request is: come join us! )</p>

<p>now, continuing the discussion from <a href="/talk/t/starting-a-pod-with-this-making-of-cregox-cast/7843/2">Starting a pod with this making of "cregox cast"</a>:</p>

<h1>read my mind</h1>

<p>rules are simple. host brings up a topic, then write down something about it that other players will have to guess. each player will have a few minutes to give it a shot after a presentation and then the answer will be revealed. so it's basically a riddle in which each player takes turn to take a guess.</p>

<p>it will happen near the cast ending because we're not sure everyone will be online near the beginning. I'll always bring a subject for this game, so we'll talk <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passage_(video_game)">about</a> <a href="http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/passage/">PASSAGE</a> (play it at least twice, <a href="http://passage.toolness.org/">online</a> if you prefer).</p>

<p>be our guest to bring up a subject for other players trying to read what's in your mind! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=1" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<h2>schedule and plans for the future</h2>

<p>as the first cast, this one will happen on a Saturday (<strong>today</strong>) at 22:00 UTC, which means I'll start broadcasting in about 5 hours. all the next ones, in case this one also brings a good result, might get moved to Sundays, at 20 UTC.</p>

<p>let's do this!</p>

<p><small>continuing the discussion from <a href="/talk/t/lets-make-a-podcast/7753/5">Let's make a podcast?</a></small></p>

<p>unedited video (starts at 40:26 and gets better around 1:22:42 when Moe "<a class="mention" href="/users/admin.r99">@admin.r99</a>" gets in):</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="5CgtXn_FTTw" data-youtube-title="cregox cast - the first" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;start=2426"></div>

<p>to join in while it's happening, <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/call/s2kz6ex26zejfd6o7fwodxr2pya">click here</a>.</p>

<p>it's like <a href="http://9to5google.com/2016/02/04/hangouts-improved-peer-to-peer/">hangouts have just improved</a> for making this startup even better! and boy, I've been making lots of making ofs lately. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=1" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>so the cast will have no theme whatsoever. the first episode however, should be a hangout around:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ai, basiux and <a>play escape</a> (which will happen in Lisbon 1 week from tomorrow)</li>
<li>more topics?</li>
<li>hopefuly finish up with a game like science or fiction?</li>
</ul>

<p>recording will be public and start in about 11 hours from now at <a href="http://timezone.io/team/cregoxcast">22:00 UTC 0</a> (<a href="http://timezone.io/join/7897e7597505796a">add yourself</a>). preparations begin now.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/admin.r99">@admin.r99</a> will be a guest and <code>everyone</code> is welcomed to join in.</p>

<p>can't wait to see what will happen out of this... <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=1" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>still need to merge the ai-poca-lips universe into a story for the first event (which shall be repeated until people ask for a new one) and make a better page explaining what it's all about and how it's still an experiment... but other than that, come in join us at lx (lisbon)!</p>

<p>today I went to <a href="https://github.com/cauerego/cauerego.github.io/wiki/basiux-game-pitch-for-sharktank">do a 3 minutes pitch</a> in a portuguese sharktank and it was so much better than I could hope for! okay, they did dismiss me in less than 5 minutes total, while they did stay with other people in there for over 10 minutes, but this was basically their feedback:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>"you're either insane or a genius, we have no clue what's your product"</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>"we're too dumb to understand what you're talking about"</strong> - to which I immediately replied something like "<em>no, I'm pretty sure I'm the fucktard who can't explain it right</em>" and they laughed. <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=1" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p></li>
<li><p><strong>"bring us a prototype"</strong> - this was a hint from my friend who was in the jury there (if not for her, I wouldn't be writing this post here). I was a bit surprised and quickly said "<em>here, it's in my pocket. want to see?</em>". <strong>"no, just apply it online. maybe we'd still call you"</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>now I need to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hvtf82s8w2gxyuk/AABceJpqaTfN6E1DWXGdkPfEa?dl=0"><strong>get this ready ASAP</strong></a>! (the application pdf needs to be completely remade, of course)</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Can you help me out?</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>it's already clear the video has to <strong>show a prototype</strong> (even if it doesn't exist yet, because it's not complete - just in beta) and it has to show the <strong>scientific evidence supporting the claim</strong>, which needs to be researched online and compiled.</p>

<p>PS: if you don't know about shark tank</p>
