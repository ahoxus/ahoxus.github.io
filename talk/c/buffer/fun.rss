<p>How? I can tell you how it won't be like, but it'd sure be fun if it's any close: <a href="http://b.cregox.com/a-novel">http://b.cregox.com/a-novel</a></p>

<p>One thing is for certain: humans and humanity will be <strong>completely changed</strong> by it. A bigger evolutional leap than anything that ever happened before.</p>

<p>And it will most certainly happen before 2040, as Ray Kurzweil genius predicts.</p>

<p>I truly cheer for start seeing it within the next 7 years (5 years before a PC can emulate a human brain on its own), but who knows? In science, any prediction with more than 5 years advance is about the same as saying "nobody knows, we can only hope".</p>

Then <a href="https://github.com/basiux/basiux.github.io/commit/e2434a33d48eef87609d6242a4221635f22c34df" rel="nofollow">again</a>.

Probably the most important aspect of that video there is being able to view <a href="https://github.com/basiux/basiux.github.io/issues/3" rel="nofollow">the missing Neural Network (due to this open issue)</a>, or at least glimpse at what it could be if we can implement it mostly unchanged. It's also the most important issue to be resolved, <a href="/talk/t/basiux-from-neural-networks-to-ai-singularity-the-new-slogan-created-after-a-sharktank-application/7819/1">right now</a>, for Mariox.

              <p>okay, maybe this is more about "tech / science" than <strong>fun</strong> but the perspective I want to bring here is more about the fun of it! <img src="/talk/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=1" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>this is the first time I'm sharing a full <a>narrative</a> moment: <a href="http://nrv.io/1Ztom6y">http://nrv.io/1Ztom6y</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia">pareidolia</a> (i.e. brain malfunction) happens with every single thing. it's basically our brain not functioning as we'd expect - it's easy to perceive it as "optical illusion", but it sure happens with <em>songs</em>, <em>smelling</em>, <em>self perception</em>, <em>memories</em>, <strong><em>anything</em></strong>. in my case I think I just don't pay enough attention to too many facial details for quick pattern recognition.</p>

<p>here's another fun one for most people:</p>
