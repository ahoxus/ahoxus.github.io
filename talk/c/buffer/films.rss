<h1>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1193138/combined">Up in the Air</a>; 87.5% (0111111)</h1>

<p><small>Exact same score as <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/stricly-sexual-2008-22-24-is-a-little-underrated-jewel-and-almost-perfect-in-every-sense-consistent-caring/7817">the only other movie I've rated</a>, kept me thinking about remaking the criteria, but I couldn't come up with another one for now.</small></p>

<p><span class="spoiler">Many open endings</span> pretty much sums up the flick to me. Make no mistake, you'll make mistakes. Life is like a box of chocolates a wise woman once said and here we can see how that's played in a complicated environment.</p>

<p>Sharp dialogues, filled with remarkable lines, although it's mostly narrating events many would dream to live and nobody really do, the story does bring many common portraits anyone can identify with, such as a "glue" sister that keeps trying to keep the family together with her own contradictions or a stupid collectors wish to build an unique huge selection of whatever they want to "win".</p>

<p>It's my opinion life is a game, and a competitive one, in the same sense a "cooperative" game can be one in which a group's intelligence play against a environment's IQ, which relies on how much complexity the creator could put in there. We're always striving to <strong>win</strong> something, dividing the game of existence into smaller ones to better comprehend its rules and be able to play it.</p>

<p>Why gamifying something so unique and more valuable than anything else in our little known universe? You may ask. Why not? I ask you back. It's a way to make it more fun and enjoyable for everyone, if done with at least this <strong>one rule</strong>: respect everyone's else choice on how they play theirs. This movie seems to agree.</p>

<h1>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0494277/combined">Strictly Sexual</a> ; 87.5% (0111111)</h1>

<p>I won't be surprised if I change this to 16/16 in the near future, after finding out about how much psycho science was actually put into this... But since right now I have no clue, I'll just give my safest score to it.</p>

<p>Not sure <em>why</em> I rated this 7 when I first watched it, about 6 or 5 years ago. This is now the first movie I'm rating according to this brand new movie rating scale I just made up precisely because I wanted to properly rate this flick - and it's a definite IMDB 10 for me, even while not apparently perfect.</p>

<p>It's hard to write about this without any <strong>spoilers</strong>... From here below, you might want to simply skip or leave for reading afterwards.</p>

<p>I once thought the ending was a bit <span class="spoiler">"coward" (offering the realistic and romantic ending 2 in 1) but in reality the mix is quite good plus a bit refreshing</span>. There was this <span class="spoiler">unexplained main character's mood switch</span> near the ending, which could have been better stitched, but other than that, all I know about the movie is what I read in the one review quoted below which leads me to my <strong>many kudos</strong> to Stevie Long! Really a piece of art. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=1" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>Again, watched it without knowing anything, and I haven't digged it down enough but... Really thought <span class="spoiler">the writer and director were the same person and <strong>then</strong> after realizing he was courageously the main instead it made even more sense!</span> I'd bet Stevie directed the director. Just <strong>legendary</strong>. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=1" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p><details><summary>Strictly Sensational! - review from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/user/ur20267352/">(crimeflix)</a></summary>

<ul>
<li>10/10</li>
<li>8 December 2008</li>
</ul>

<p>I was lucky enough to see an advance screening of this film earlier in the year and it absolutely rocks. It's an edgy, hilarious, ultimately charming romantic comedy. The script, direction and ensemble cast are terrific. Amber Benson delivers what might be the most nuanced performance of her career. Newcomer (and screenwriter) Stevie Long steals scenes in a performance on par with Jon Favreau in Swingers. The structure of the film is reminiscent of Woody Allen's work, particularly Annie Hall and Manhattan, but with a hip, updated feel. The film has been a huge hit in Europe and I hope that carries over in the U.S. Highly recommended! Jason Starr, author of THE FOLLOWER and TWISTED CITY.</p>
