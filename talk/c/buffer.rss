<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote>
<p>scientifically I'd say you could think of Ai with 3 axis: <em>logic</em>, <em>philosophy</em> and <em>arts</em>.</p>
<p><em>(if this answer gets enough interest I'll expand more)</em></p>
<p><strong>logic</strong><br>that's the binary world, the same one that constructs math and progamming*. you can't have any kind of intelligence without a solid logic.</p>
<p><strong>philosophy</strong><br>this is the spiritual world, looked upon mostly through logic (i.e. with much intelligence).</p>
<p><strong>arts</strong><br>materialization. Ai is a lot about ideas but nothing of that matters if you can't bring it to the real world. making a spam filter out of pure logic is an awesome piece art and, make no mistake, programming is a form of art! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=1" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>---</p>
<p>there really is nothing in your life you can't use to learn about researching for Ai, specially if you're talking about the tech singularity. <strong>anything works</strong>.</p>
<p>now, if all you want is weak Ai, the one being sold today, you can leave <strong>philosophy</strong> behind and focus most your efforts in <strong>logic</strong> and, if you're lucky enough, make tons of money with it, with a good enough <strong>art</strong>. just keep in mind money isn't everything - it's just 1/3 of it.</p>

<p>if you know me you should be able to guess it properly as <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-do-I-need-to-learn-in-order-to-research-artificial-intelligence/answer/Caue-Rego">the right answer is one filled with 3 elements</a>: <strong>logic + art + philosophy</strong>.</p>

<p>( still unsure of what's the best category for buffering this... since it's on "help", the request is: come join us! )</p>

<p>now, continuing the discussion from <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/starting-a-pod-with-this-making-of-cregox-cast/7843/2">Starting a pod with this making of "cregox cast"</a>:</p>

<h1>read my mind</h1>

<p>rules are simple. host brings up a topic, then write down something about it that other players will have to guess. each player will have a few minutes to give it a shot after a presentation and then the answer will be revealed. so it's basically a riddle in which each player takes turn to take a guess.</p>

<p>it will happen near the cast ending because we're not sure everyone will be online near the beginning. I'll always bring a subject for this game, so we'll talk <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passage_(video_game)">about</a> <a href="http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/passage/">PASSAGE</a> (play it at least twice, <a href="http://passage.toolness.org/">online</a> if you prefer).</p>

<p>be our guest to bring up a subject for other players trying to read what's in your mind! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=1" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<h2>schedule and plans for the future</h2>

<p>as the first cast, this one will happen on a Saturday (<strong>today</strong>) at 22:00 UTC, which means I'll start broadcasting in about 5 hours. all the next ones, in case this one also brings a good result, might get moved to Sundays, at 20 UTC.</p>

<p>let's do this!</p>

<p><strong>keep</strong> is, imho, extremely superior to <strong>evernote</strong> for a single reason: it just works. everywhere and fast. no installation even needed.</p>

<p>both have a huge problem: no automated local backups. not even with ifttt or whatever. both can recover from a time machine backup, but it's not all that reliable and it wouldn't really survive the product being pulling off. they both <em>think</em> they'll exist forever and the web is at least 99.999%.</p>

<p>keep probably don't work offline as good as evernote as well, and the elephant has an awesome OCR. but keep have notes colors, an awesome grid view, easy to take simple or complex notes and blazing fast to search them, etc. you know, it's a google product.</p>

<p>google's have a bigger problem: it's <strong>google</strong>. <a href="https://gigaom.com/2013/03/20/sorry-google-you-can-keep-it-to-yourself/">who knows what's going to be the next reader shut down</a>?</p>

<p>the simple solution would be making independent teams within google, who could easily be their own company if google feels the need to pull the plug. also people can follow products by the people, which is what should matter most. sorry apple, jobs less apple is another company. and it will "die", at very least, like ibm and microsoft did.</p>

<p>the ideal candidate to win over both? <strong>github</strong>. but it's not there yet, as well... funny enough, for GitHub I'm only missing a simple unified gui experience in every single platform, which is much easier to overcome than any other problem from the concurrents.</p>

<p>unedited video (starts at 40:26 and gets better around 1:22:42 when Moe "<a class="mention" href="/users/admin.r99">@admin.r99</a>" gets in):</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="5CgtXn_FTTw" data-youtube-title="cregox cast - the first" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;start=2426"></div>

<p>to join in while it's happening, <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/call/s2kz6ex26zejfd6o7fwodxr2pya">click here</a>.</p>

<p>it's like <a href="http://9to5google.com/2016/02/04/hangouts-improved-peer-to-peer/">hangouts have just improved</a> for making this startup even better! and boy, I've been making lots of making ofs lately. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=1" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>so the cast will have no theme whatsoever. the first episode however, should be a hangout around:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ai, basiux and <a>play escape</a> (which will happen in Lisbon 1 week from tomorrow)</li>
<li>more topics?</li>
<li>hopefuly finish up with a game like science or fiction?</li>
</ul>

<p>recording will be public and start in about 11 hours from now at <a href="http://timezone.io/team/cregoxcast">22:00 UTC 0</a> (<a href="http://timezone.io/join/7897e7597505796a">add yourself</a>). preparations begin now.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/admin.r99">@admin.r99</a> will be a guest and <code>everyone</code> is welcomed to join in.</p>

<p>can't wait to see what will happen out of this... <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=1" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>when I join in around minute 11 everything slows down for a while, I was already sleepy and trying to figure out why it was so slow, and it was obviously thanks to my terrible non-fiber 0.5 mbps upstream internet here at historical lisbon center. <strong>I promise the broadcast gets better</strong> later on, if you enjoy artificial intelligence, science and / or philosophy.</p>

<p>topics touched:</p>

<ul>
<li>autonomous cars and tesla ( <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/models">https://www.teslamotors.com/models</a> )</li>
<li>tesla and elon musk ( <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/models">https://www.teslamotors.com/models</a> )</li>
<li>academia Ai</li>
<li>net neutrality</li>
<li>golf bot and tiger woods</li>
<li>chicken or the egg ( <a href="http://www.basiux.org/#mariox">www.basiux.org/#mariox</a> )</li>
<li>reinforced mixed learning</li>
<li>bitcoins</li>
<li>universe determinism</li>
</ul>

<p>I participate in those since the first one (but unfortunately not in all of them) and I think anyone can join. this is the first one I'm aware that's being broadcast, but just near the ending. <code>Moe</code> does a great job <a href="http://timezone.io/team/codenewbieai">organizing</a> 'em and putting things together, along with <a href="https://codenewbie.slack.com/archives/ai/p1454713220000253">the slack channel</a>.</p>

<p>now, this is just in: <a href="https://codenewbie.slack.com/archives/basiux">that hangout may</a> soon become <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/lets-make-a-podcast/7753">the podcast</a>!!</p>

<p>How? I can tell you how it won't be like, but it'd sure be fun if it's any close: <a href="http://b.cregox.com/a-novel">http://b.cregox.com/a-novel</a></p>

<p>One thing is for certain: humans and humanity will be <strong>completely changed</strong> by it. A bigger evolutional leap than anything that ever happened before.</p>

<p>And it will most certainly happen before 2040, as Ray Kurzweil genius predicts.</p>

<p>I truly cheer for start seeing it within the next 7 years (5 years before a PC can emulate a human brain on its own), but who knows? In science, any prediction with more than 5 years advance is about the same as saying "nobody knows, we can only hope".</p>

<p>still need to merge the ai-poca-lips universe into a story for the first event (which shall be repeated until people ask for a new one) and make a better page explaining what it's all about and how it's still an experiment... but other than that, come in join us at lx (lisbon)!</p>

<p>This is just a quote to this link for my answer on quora: <a href="http://qr.ae/ROw3G7">http://qr.ae/ROw3G7</a></p>

<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote>
<p>In short: it's already helping. Everyone. When you google for something, there's a huge big data Ai in place to give you the best answers. Try Siri and you'll have a glimpse of what Ai can do, and that's still a very weak Ai.</p>
<p>Do you need more than getting answers to any important question almost instantly? Well, the best games out there use heavy Ai - the biggest e-sport game in DOTA style is also one with the most advanced Ai systems in place. How that helps? It helps easing up our mind from the craziness around. A mindfulness technique.</p>
<p>And, yet, all is using Ai as smart as a bacteria. Kind of.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>I won't get into much details, but you may be very skeptical of the last part in the second paragraph. Or even the third one. As you should. And if you are, do your homework. You'll probably find out I'm not too far off from the reality.</p>
<p>"How can Ai help countries in need" could be a way to reword your question. Then, which country don't need help from a superior intelligence? Why focusing only on "developing" countries? Of course there must be something we can do for everyone and most of "everyone" are in the poor region, but make no mistake - most people are poor because they prefer the simplicity of life. Capitalism isn't a zero-sum game and everyone have a choice in one way or another. There sure is misery out there, but even that is almost like a choice.</p>
<p>Here, this is a very geeky pseudo-code I just wrote about Life:</p>

</aside>

<p>In my humble opinion, the best way to use Ai in favor of our humanity is by doing what most intelligent people are already doing and heavily investing into making something like openai.com - a free, open and non profit Ai code, made by everyone, aiming at improving our mental health.</p>

<h1>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1193138/combined">Up in the Air</a>; 87.5% (0111111)</h1>

<p><small>Exact same score as <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/stricly-sexual-2008-22-24-is-a-little-underrated-jewel-and-almost-perfect-in-every-sense-consistent-caring/7817">the only other movie I've rated</a>, kept me thinking about remaking the criteria, but I couldn't come up with another one for now.</small></p>

<p><span class="spoiler">Many open endings</span> pretty much sums up the flick to me. Make no mistake, you'll make mistakes. Life is like a box of chocolates a wise woman once said and here we can see how that's played in a complicated environment.</p>

<p>Sharp dialogues, filled with remarkable lines, although it's mostly narrating events many would dream to live and nobody really do, the story does bring many common portraits anyone can identify with, such as a "glue" sister that keeps trying to keep the family together with her own contradictions or a stupid collectors wish to build an unique huge selection of whatever they want to "win".</p>

<p>It's my opinion life is a game, and a competitive one, in the same sense a "cooperative" game can be one in which a group's intelligence play against a environment's IQ, which relies on how much complexity the creator could put in there. We're always striving to <strong>win</strong> something, dividing the game of existence into smaller ones to better comprehend its rules and be able to play it.</p>

<p>Why gamifying something so unique and more valuable than anything else in our little known universe? You may ask. Why not? I ask you back. It's a way to make it more fun and enjoyable for everyone, if done with at least this <strong>one rule</strong>: respect everyone's else choice on how they play theirs. This movie seems to agree.</p>

<p>today I went to <a href="https://github.com/cauerego/cauerego.github.io/wiki/basiux-game-pitch-for-sharktank">do a 3 minutes pitch</a> in a portuguese sharktank and it was so much better than I could hope for! okay, they did dismiss me in less than 5 minutes total, while they did stay with other people in there for over 10 minutes, but this was basically their feedback:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>"you're either insane or a genius, we have no clue what's your product"</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>"we're too dumb to understand what you're talking about"</strong> - to which I immediately replied something like "<em>no, I'm pretty sure I'm the fucktard who can't explain it right</em>" and they laughed. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=1" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p></li>
<li><p><strong>"bring us a prototype"</strong> - this was a hint from my friend who was in the jury there (if not for her, I wouldn't be writing this post here). I was a bit surprised and quickly said "<em>here, it's in my pocket. want to see?</em>". <strong>"no, just apply it online. maybe we'd still call you"</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>now I need to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hvtf82s8w2gxyuk/AABceJpqaTfN6E1DWXGdkPfEa?dl=0"><strong>get this ready ASAP</strong></a>! (the application pdf needs to be completely remade, of course)</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Can you help me out?</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>it's already clear the video has to <strong>show a prototype</strong> (even if it doesn't exist yet, because it's not complete - just in beta) and it has to show the <strong>scientific evidence supporting the claim</strong>, which needs to be researched online and compiled.</p>

<p>PS: if you don't know about shark tank</p>

<h1>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0494277/combined">Strictly Sexual</a> ; 87.5% (0111111)</h1>

<p>I won't be surprised if I change this to 16/16 in the near future, after finding out about how much psycho science was actually put into this... But since right now I have no clue, I'll just give my safest score to it.</p>

<p>Not sure <em>why</em> I rated this 7 when I first watched it, about 6 or 5 years ago. This is now the first movie I'm rating according to this brand new movie rating scale I just made up precisely because I wanted to properly rate this flick - and it's a definite IMDB 10 for me, even while not apparently perfect.</p>

<p>It's hard to write about this without any <strong>spoilers</strong>... From here below, you might want to simply skip or leave for reading afterwards.</p>

<p>I once thought the ending was a bit <span class="spoiler">"coward" (offering the realistic and romantic ending 2 in 1) but in reality the mix is quite good plus a bit refreshing</span>. There was this <span class="spoiler">unexplained main character's mood switch</span> near the ending, which could have been better stitched, but other than that, all I know about the movie is what I read in the one review quoted below which leads me to my <strong>many kudos</strong> to Stevie Long! Really a piece of art. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=1" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>Again, watched it without knowing anything, and I haven't digged it down enough but... Really thought <span class="spoiler">the writer and director were the same person and <strong>then</strong> after realizing he was courageously the main instead it made even more sense!</span> I'd bet Stevie directed the director. Just <strong>legendary</strong>. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=1" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p><details><summary>Strictly Sensational! - review from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/user/ur20267352/">(crimeflix)</a></summary>

<ul>
<li>10/10</li>
<li>8 December 2008</li>
</ul>

<p>I was lucky enough to see an advance screening of this film earlier in the year and it absolutely rocks. It's an edgy, hilarious, ultimately charming romantic comedy. The script, direction and ensemble cast are terrific. Amber Benson delivers what might be the most nuanced performance of her career. Newcomer (and screenwriter) Stevie Long steals scenes in a performance on par with Jon Favreau in Swingers. The structure of the film is reminiscent of Woody Allen's work, particularly Annie Hall and Manhattan, but with a hip, updated feel. The film has been a huge hit in Europe and I hope that carries over in the U.S. Highly recommended! Jason Starr, author of THE FOLLOWER and TWISTED CITY.</p>

Movies are all about storytelling. 

Disclaimer about The Rating Scale

For the longest time, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/user/ur1256176/?ref_=nv_usr_prof_2">my IMDB profile</a> says something like this: 

 

Also for the longest time, I wished to make a better <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/anything-advisor/7426">rating system</a> in general. Maybe <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/from-wildcard-through-computers-to-the-unknown/7636?u=cregox">the first manifestation</a> of that wish happened almost 1 year ago. Something like <a href="http://slant.co">slant.co</a> but maybe even simpler and even better. 

After (re)watching [Strictly Sexual] yesterday, finding it a 10, and having to re-scale it from 7, I've decided to finally starting do…

<p><small>This was hard to summarize in such a small space, but it's also not that big of a buffer. I would normally add this to <a href="/c/buffer/fun">fun</a> but, being an RFC, I guess tech suits better.</small></p>

<p>No photos in this post (as I try to always do in buffer) because the link has it all and this is a lot of reading material.</p>

<p>The links with deeper explanations are all there, including for "the advisor", on the right side. The explanation is also there, on the Disclaimer. So, I guess the only thing left to say is: <strong>could</strong> you <strong>please <em>read it all</em></strong> and then <strong>comment</strong>? <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=1" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>outreaching is where most of the work is done, and there are many tools you can use, although none is really needed. the point is making good questions to ask them on their field of expertise, so you'll have both great content to compile and an audience who will love to hear other experts feedback on that same question.</p>

<p>the steps are in much detail although not really so well described in <a href="http://www.matthewwoodward.co.uk/tutorials/crowdsource-blog-content">this ugly link</a>, but I promise getting aware of the core idea there is <strong>very</strong> interesting.</p>

<p>I haven't done it myself just yet, for it is a lot of work and, well, I couldn't set my mind to do it. But I will, and it will be awesome! <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slightly_smiling.png?v=1" title=":slightly_smiling:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling:"></p>

also, for context, I wrote the post while I was very inspired and <a href="http://talk.cregox.com/t/two-weeks-i-havent-updated-the-novel-any-ideas-or-feedback-anyone/7806">writing the 3 novel chapters</a> that will probably not get any bigger unless people manifest themselves. 

since then, I've also added a buffer post about this. 

novels, being a creation of human imagination, and the hugely flawed human brain, have no validation on the much bigger REAL UNIVERSE, the one and only, basiux's true GOD (church of tech's god is basiux, but basiux's god is the universe). 

yes…

<p>By re-reading that post, I thought it would fit better here in <a href="/c/buffer">buffer</a> given its size. But, instead of moving it I decided to just clarify it and link here, with a more descriptive title. <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slightly_smiling.png?v=1" title=":slightly_smiling:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling:"></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia">pareidolia</a> (i.e. brain malfunction) happens with every single thing. it's basically our brain not functioning as we'd expect - it's easy to perceive it as "optical illusion", but it sure happens with <em>songs</em>, <em>smelling</em>, <em>self perception</em>, <em>memories</em>, <strong><em>anything</em></strong>. in my case I think I just don't pay enough attention to too many facial details for quick pattern recognition.</p>

<p>I wrote all of the below before reading <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/o-e-mail-que-me-levou-at%C3%A9-sede-do-google-em-s%C3%A3o-galileu-nogueira?deepLinkCommentId=6092633209772789762&amp;anchorTime=1452596952874&amp;trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_REPLY_TOP_LEVEL_COMMENT">a very inspiring article (in portuguese)</a> which basically brings the same idea but made me look at it from another angle, to which I changed the title from "<em>Why you should apply only for jobs that matter</em>".</p>

<hr>

<p>For one, because you'll regret if you do get a meaningless job, no matter how high the amount paid. You just will, sooner or later. Unless you are one in a gazillion that may indeed have no physiological mind issues with it (as always, words are carefully chosen here).</p>

<p>Also because nobody should be applying for jobs.
