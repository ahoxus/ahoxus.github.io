              <p>I was going to ask a question very similar to <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/121259/can-light-affect-gravity">Can light affect gravity</a> but not based in any theory, just trying to better understand General Relativity in my own way. Then, when I started writing and elaborating more about it, I noticed the kernel of my question might actually be about the big bang... Now, back to the beginning:</p>

<blockquote><p>According to special relativity, <em>C</em> is the maximum speed at which all matter and information in the universe can travel.</p></blockquote>

<p>This still rubs me in the wrong way. Like the space time continuum, a 4 dimensional comprised of 3 spaces and 1 in time, doesn't seen right, but that's to another topic...</p>

<p>So, after watching this <em><strong>awesome</strong> 7 minute video</em> explaining it in "very simple" terms, I went to (had to go) researching more about General Relativity and stuff:</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="CYv5GsXEf1o" data-youtube-title="Breakthrough Junior Challenge: Some Cool Ways of Looking at the Special Theory of Relativity" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

<p>While watching the video I was just reafirming my previous knowledge up to the precise 5:00 point, when he says "speed of light is constant, <strong>as long as</strong> you're measuring it from a reference frame that's moving at a constant velocity". I now realize that's a bit far from being very precise, but it was also bringing to me a new idea. It's not what I understood of the <em>C</em> light Constant.</p>

<p>To me, light speed was <em>universally always constant</em>, regardless of the reference frame! Which was mind blowing and made little sense, when I wrapped my head around it a bit. Now it's back to make no sense, and I'm glad it was a wrong picture I've made!</p>

<p>In reality, <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/2290/70637">I now understand</a> it still moves at that constant speed, relatively to anything else, <strong>but</strong> always dependant on the fabric of spacetime it's immersed into. This can easily accounts to what Ryan Chester genius kid meant in his sentence there (and to what truly can be observed).</p>

<p>Light will still be moving <em>C</em> faster than any "<em>stationary</em>" object, in vacuum, if both are under "<em>the same roof</em>" and even if that "<em>roof</em>" is moving at 99.99999...% the <em>C</em> speed of light.</p>

<p>But what does <code>moving at</code> even mean, in that case, if every movement is relative? There always seem to be some kind of absolute reference implicit in every speech I hear or read. Is that absolute frame the big bang? I guess so! No idea, really.</p>

<p>Anyway, in the end, this is still all just some random thoughts, I guess. Should mark it as <code>open draft</code> (a.k.a. <code>spoilers</code> category, around here) and move on for now.</p>

<p>Here are some more thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>A huge body of mass affects the space time continuum, through gravity waves moving at <em>C</em>, where a lot of energy is somehow used <code>E = M * C ^2</code>
</li>
<li>Light (and other particles) move so fast and have so little mass that they can't be easily affected by the space time - only huge amounts of energy can bend space time enough to interfere with light.</li>

              <p>A series of 2 great recent videos summarize very well a lot of what I was trying to write about what I think of determinism. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0">What is Random?</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE">What is NOT Random?</a></p>

<p>But one of them comes to the conclusion the universe isn't deterministic simply by looking at its entropy as we know today. While I think the 4 dimensional universe usually credited as Einstein's idea sounds bogus, I agree with him: the universe must be deterministic. Or, as he said it "<em>God does not play dice</em>". This is one of my hard faith beliefs.</p>

<p>10 years ago I've completely changed my faith pillars such as this one, and when it happened I also felt one of the best feelings I've ever did. Changing the root beliefes, unlike many fear, is quite pleasurable. I'm not sure if it helped me much or not, I'm not where I'd like to be today, so maybe I do need a new brain format... But this isn't it. It's very very far from it, in fact.</p>

<p><a href="http://cauecmrego.blogspot.com.br/2014/07/why-so-many-people-have-illusion-chance.html">I wrote a blog post about this very subject a few months ago</a>, but I was trying to polish it better. Re-reading it now I see I could do it simply by removing some negativity I was adding in the end. Maybe the videos helped me realizing that...</p>

<p>So, what's the point of all this? Well, if you believe the universe isn't deterministic and that God does play dices, then all we can do is hope and have faith in randomness. Maybe that's why I choose to believe otherwise, that way if only for a fraction of second we can determine what's going to happen to 1 single person in 1 single time in the future, to me, that'd be the most satisfying achievements of all. It's either possible to do it or impossible, right? I believe this is possible even if not in my lifetime.</p>

          <title>Optimal diet for most people</title>

              <p>On <a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/469">episode #469</a> Steve says that, for the average person, or most people, the optimal diet consists about 90% of this: "<strong>Eat a variety of food, a lot of plant food and not too much.</strong>"</p>

<p>That sounds very reasonable, but doesn't the "a lot of plant food" part of it exist only because nowadays we eat too little plants? If we lived in a society where people would eat mostly plants, wouldn't that be replaced by "a lot of meat"? I mean, as a general rule, that sounds a little confusing to me. And, as a general rule, I find it too hard to find similar data on the webs.</p>

              <p><em>I've send this to Evan's email, wtn...</em></p>

<p>I doubt this is it, but it sounds very much like a song played by some bottled gas vending trucks here in Brazil.</p>

<p>More than trying to get it right, I wanted to share this little story about that song...</p>

<p>My father invented, created and produced this solution to increase the bottled gas company sales. He then came up with this idea to replace the trucks horns with a nice song. After some years of research, he came up with this, around 1990:</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="lP_79NLIYbg" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

<p>The original song had an actual better quality, with a good sound equipment. It was played by a small microchipped system, one of the first "computers" on board back then, to keep the quality up and to prevent truckers to play it more than once every 2 minutes. At least that's the story I recall... <img src="//talk-cdn.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>It was so successful that there came the pirates. Many people (at least in this country) now know his idea only thanks to the very annoying pirate which plays a pour elise version that sounds pretty much like that one you played on <a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/468">episode #468</a></p>

              <p>The title is a mix up of a <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/what-can-men-do/"><strong>recent blog post</strong></a> I've read with <a href="http://cauecmrego.blogspot.com.br/2013/11/is-there-anything-good-about-men-by-roy.html"><strong>one of my favourite texts on the gender subject</strong></a>. To add to it, I also recently had an argument with wife because I was posting <a href="http://www.quora.com/Questions-That-Contain-Assumptions/Why-do-women-wear-clothes-that-would-show-their-curves-even-when-they-know-that-men-are-looking-for-it/answer/Caue-C-M-Rego">an answer on quora</a> which I accidently found while looking for a <a href="http://www.quora.com/Makeup/Why-do-men-tell-women-that-they-prefer-them-without-make-up/answer/Caue-C-M-Rego">previous answer on a related subject</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike most of the links, I want to be as brief as possible here. But, <strong>beware</strong>, this will be a highly flammable topic if you don't <em>read</em> at least the first two links above!</p>

<p>Programming languages are languages. I think everyone should know at least 2. <a href="http://code.org/"><strong>Everyone</strong></a>. 2 languages and 2 programming ones. But the later is a field completely dominated by men and so the <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/what-can-men-do/">first link here proposes 5 things men could do to begin changing that</a>, which are great! But I think Jeff don't acknowledge the <a href="http://cauecmrego.blogspot.com.br/2013/11/is-there-anything-good-about-men-by-roy.html">second link, about differences between men and women</a> while proposing them and it is something that comes before all that.</p>

<p><strong>Women are different from men. And vice-versa.</strong></p>

<p>Of course, the environment has to be favorable... But women have to gather interest in programming somehow, preferably since childhood. This unproportional men to women ratio scenario exist today not just due to a supposed hostile learning ground for girls. It's also because women naturally have no interest in technology. Maybe even mainly so. And then this scenario would only naturally change <strong>if first</strong> women could see something which might interest them. The technology have to be just a tool for them, unlike for men <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_philosophy">who can enjoy philosophy</a> much more, for instance. Men enjoy "wasting time" just thinking. In this sense, women are much more practical.</p>

<p>So no, I don't think there's anything men can do to make women learn programming language today. There's too little that technology can do for them. There is still much that can be done at least to improve the environment for them, and for the future. And who knows when, eventually  we might start <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119794/combined">programming by <em>talking</em></a> (not dictating) to computers... By then, maybe we'll have more female programmers than male! <img src="//talk.cregox.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt="stuck_out_tongue" width="64" height="64"> </p>

<p>Your laptop's Webcam has a light that's supposed to turn on any time the camera does. But research shows it's possible for hackers to disable the light.</p>

<p>And I thought this was hard wired and not possible to break without hardware access... Now I wonder how difficult it would be to just feed that led through camera energy activation alone.</p>
