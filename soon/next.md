before [tamera](/tamera) and focusing the project in community... there was little clue what ahoxus was!

this was (and still is) a plan for developing the page and blurred idea a bit further...

# {{ page.description }}

**white hole!**

below there are 2 simulations from the first black hole ever seen.

<details>
  <summary markdown="span">![black hole simulation](/{{ page.category }}/blackhole.hq.gif)</summary>
  
  this one in YouTube is much cooler, though... and probably even more precise!

  {% include youtube.html id='KikdPbX7z8Q' ratio='56.25%' video='blackhole.mp4' %}
</details>

now we shall do our own ahoxus version, you know, for promotion! ;)

the idea is simply using our colors there, with some mutation and the white background instead of black.

thus, becoming our beloved white hole.

{% include ahoxus.svg %}
