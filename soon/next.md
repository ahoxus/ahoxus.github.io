before [tamera](/tamera) and focusing the project in community... there was little clue what ahoxus was!

this was (and still is) a plan for developing the page and blurred idea a bit further...

# {{ page.description }}

**white hole!**

below there are 2 simulations from the first black hole ever seen.

</video>

this first one, red and plain, was done even before we saw it... remarkable, isn't it?

{% include youtube.html id='KikdPbX7z8Q' ratio='56.25%' alt='30 minute loop - rotating accretion flow kerr black hole simulation' %}

but we actually prefer the second one, with double spinning around all axis. it is much cooler and probably even more precise!

next, we shall do our own ahoxus version, you know, for promotion! üòè

the idea is simply using our colors there, with some mutation and the white  background instead of black. also just a dozen circles or so, ordered in that somewhat chaotic fashion...

... and turning into our beloved white hole.
